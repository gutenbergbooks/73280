<h2>JOURNAL OF ELIZABETH LADY HOLLAND</h2>
</div>

<p><i>26th July, 1799.</i>—Left H. H. this morning to make a tour into
Wales and the west of England. Ld. H. went to dine at St. Anne’s, and
Drew, Charles, and myself came to this place (General Fitzpatrick’s,
Sunninghill) to meet him. On Saturday, ye 27th, we arrived to dinner
at Oxford. Close by the General’s, upon Ascot Heath, there is a camp.
The cavalry were watered whilst we went on the road, a pretty incident;
their brilliant coats contrasted with the dusky brown of the heath,
and produced a very lively effect. A cross road to Henley; just as
we entered the town we passed under Park Place, a late purchase of
Ld. Malmesbury’s. Somewhere near Henley is the highest ground south
of Trent. On ye 28th went from Oxford, by Chapel House, to Warwick.
I could not help laughing at the <i>event</i> of our going, because
the subject of seeing the Castle without being obliged by urgent
solicitations to make a long visit there (as Ld. H. was sure we should
be very much pressed) had occupied his thoughts for many hours. Ld.
H. had written letters to Ly. W. and Mrs. Smith, so calculated as to
make a refusal of the pressing invitations (which he dreaded having)
quite civil; but we need not have been embarrassed. So far from being
solicited to stay, the whole family flew to their fortresses in some
battlemented towers, gave out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span> that they were walking, and shunned us.
It was a most fortunate escape to me, tho’ I believe Ld. H. was vexed
at the impertinence of the proceeding. The Castle is magnificent,
decorated with ornaments appropriate to the building, and in the very
best taste possible. His taste in virtu is better than in breeding, as
he manifested a gross deficiency of that quality to us.</p>

<p>From thence we went across a very moderate road to Kenilworth; by
the remains of the castle it appears to have far exceeded Warwick in
splendour and extent.</p>

<p>On ye 29th we went through Birmingham. Having seen it last year we
did not stop, but went straight on to the Leasowes, a spot rendered
celebrated by Shenstone; it is very unworthy of the praise he bestowed
upon it, and is now fallen into decay. About three miles further is
Hagley; the park is very beautiful, the house simple. The comfortless
taste prevalent in England of placing the house in a lawn where sheep
and cattle feed close to the windows, instead of ornamental gardens,
gives rather a disconsolate appearance to it; otherwise it is almost as
desirable as a country residence (a bad thing at best) can be. It was
built by the <i>good</i> Ld. Lyttelton,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> as he is generally called to
distinguish him from his son, who, in contradistinction, is termed the
<i>bad</i>. His much-loved wife, whom he celebrates under the name of
Lucy, is buried in the church. It destroys the pathos excited by his
elegy, if one recollects that within two years of her death he married
a fat, vulgar, rich widow, for her wealth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">IRON BRIDGES</div>

<p>Went thro’ Bridgenorth, situated picturesquely upon the Severn, which,
by-the-bye, is a yellow, muddy stream flowing with some rapidity, its
only beauty. From thence we went to Coalbrookdale to sleep. There is
the first iron bridge that was constructed; it is more curious from its
novelty and use than beautiful. I deprecate their becoming general, as
they are far inferior in point of beauty to those of stone; the dull
black of the iron assorts ill with limpid streams and verdant banks,
whereas on the contrary nothing can offer a more beautiful object than
a stone bridge of well-turned arches. The inhabitants are chiefly
quakers. During the American war they were offered a high gratification
if they would cast cannon; they replied that they worked for the
benefit of mankind, and not for their destruction, and peremptorily
refused. It is an increasing place.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, 30th, got to Shrewsbury, a place for ever distinguished
by the fall of the gallant Percy. One of the most admirable of
Shakespeare’s plays commemorates this event. What can be better than
the scene between the Triumvirate partitioning out the spoils of
Britain, the impetuosity of Hotspur, and the arrogant credulity of
Glendower? The crafty Worcester is a well-drawn character.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Passing Llanrwst, Conway, and Bangor they reached Carnarvon
on August 3rd.</p>
</div>

<p><i>4th August. Sunday.</i>—We left Carnarvon to go to Welsh Pool. From
that place to Tan y Bwlch the road is over a high mountain. Snowdon in
sight to our left.</p>

<p>Before Tan y Bwlch we came to Pont y Aberglassen, a remarkable salmon
leap; Ld. H. screamed with delight at the sight of the salmons leaping
up. It is a pretty sight. Myself, I could have looked at them with
delight for an hour or two. At Tan y Bwlch, a small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span> solitary inn,
we found every room occupied. The Judges were there. The civility of
some gentlemen enabled us to be under cover in a decent room whilst
we dined, but the house was so full that we were compelled to go on
nineteen miles at half-past seven, a mountainous road and a stormy
night, to Dolgelly; I wonder how we achieved it amidst the torrents
and precipices safely. The weather was so bad the next day that we saw
nothing.</p>

<p><i>6th August.</i>—This morning, set off from M——; such a deluge
of rain that we saw nothing to our right or left. To-night we are at
Welsh Pool, so disgusted with the roads and climate that we have some
thoughts of giving up doing Aberystwith. The beauties of Wales are very
inferior both to those of Scotland and Cumberland. The mts. are not so
lofty, the torrents are small and noiseless, no cascades: in short, the
old castles are alone worthy of notice. The country generally is thinly
inhabited; the postillions are chiefly boys, their men being either in
the army or employed in the navy. The Evil visibly afflicts a large
portion of the people.</p>

<p>On ye 7th of August we had a day very unusual; it did not rain. We
drove to Powys Castle, which is about a mile from Welsh Pool. It is
finely situated upon an eminence that commands the country around; the
place is neglected and the house is rambling and comfortless. In the
park is a fathomless pool, which gives name to the adjacent town. We
were obliged to stay the whole of the 7th, as horses were not to be
had. In the eve. Ld. H. and I had a very snug walk again to the castle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WELSH SCENERY</div>

<p>On the 8th we set off for Aberystwith, and as the same horses were to
carry us great part of the way we stopped to dine at Newtown, the road
to which was extremely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span> pleasing. Round hills covered to their summits
with thick wood, and a verdant vale with pretty rivers and cattle
grazing; it might have made a good study for quiet home views. We
crossed a rapid river without a bridge.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, 13th.</i>—Left Aberystwith. We intended originally to have
gone to Cardigan, Haverfordwest, etc., but the judges were upon that
circuit, the roads bad, and the weather wretched. On that night we
slept at Lampeter, close upon a rapid river in which Ld. H. fished. The
eve. was tolerably fine. Drew and I walked about the environs.</p>

<p><i>14th.</i>—It had rained all night, and the rivers were so swelled
that they were deep to pass through; we went thro’ several and arrived
at Carmarthen to dine. Very heavy rain the whole day. Poor little
Charles was unwell, and we decided upon giving up Tenby.</p>

<p>On 15th heavy rain. After crossing ye Towy we looked back upon the
town, which appeared prettily situated, but the weather was so bad it
was impossible to see any object. The inhabitants were not surprised at
the infamy of the weather; they said it was nothing unusual.</p>

<p>Finding no horses at Neath, we were compelled to remain. We walked
to see the ruins of a small castle; the castle is not remarkable
except for the beauty of its situation, and probably was raised by
some of those Norman Barons who followed the fortunes of Fitzhamon,
the conqueror of Glamorganshire. The inn is kept by an Italian, who,
tho’ he left the happy climate in which he was born at nine years old,
yet retains enough of national <i>tournure</i> to be known amongst a
multitude of red-faced ale-drinkers as an alien. There is an archness,
not to say roguery, which, such as it is, is a thousand times better
than the stupidity and sulkiness and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span> <i>dubious honesty</i> of the
British countenance in common life.</p>

<p>On ye 17th we passed thro’ Margam, a possession of Mr. Talbot’s. There
in his park are the beautiful remains of the Priory, about which I must
look in Grove and Camden. He pulled down the mansion, but has built a
magnificent greenhouse for the preservation of some orange-trees which
belonged to William III.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The architecture is Grecian, which, close
to a fine Gothic edifice, denotes more his adherence to the fashion of
the times than his judgment in conceiving an appropriate decoration,
as the two styles clash and diminish the beauty of both. Not that I
am an enthusiastic admirer of Grecian architecture in any way but
in a temple. There, indeed, the fine column, its slim shaft, rich
architrave, cornice, and volute, surmounted with a graceful pediment,
create a species of beauty which no other can. Indeed the circular
arch, as in the Pont de Garde, where they form a bridge and aqueduct
by several tiers one above the other, is very grand; otherwise, in
vast works, I like the Gothic architecture, which, to use an affected
phrase, is more <i>impressive</i> in lofty structures. Mr. Talbot
married a cousin of Ld. H.’s, a daughter of Lord Ilchester’s.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> It
was a strange match, she about sixteen, he sixty; as yet, however, the
disproportion has not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span> affected their felicity. They live happily; a
good deal in the country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CARDIFF</div>

<p>Arrived at Cardiff after dark. Received a note from Ly. Plymouth<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
to tell me she was there; came the next morning, 18th, to breakfast.
She is scampering upon a blood horse, followed by an attorney, over
her son’s estates, settling his affairs. She complains of having found
everybody formerly employed rogues, from whence one may presume she
has fallen into the hands of some very great one. The Castle is very
handsome; in the area Ld. Bute has built a modern castellated house,
preserving in the centre one or two of the old towers.</p>

<p><i>19th.</i>—Fortunately, a fine day. Dear Charles was so unwell that
Drew wished him to have a day’s rest. Went over a very rough road to
Tintern Abbey, a delicious ruin, situated upon the banks of the Wye.
The church is almost entire; all the external walls are up and one
of the side aisles; roof off, of course. The architecture is not so
light and pleasing as Fountains Abbey, and of the monastery there are
scarcely any remains. They show a tomb and effigy of a warrior whom
they call Strongbow, Earl of Clare, who married Eva, the daughter of an
Irish King, and became himself King of Leinster, and obtained for Henry
II. the sovereignty of Ireland. In the eve. we had a charming walk upon
the Wye and saw the castle, a fine ruin, celebrated for holding out
against Cromwell, defended by Kemyss and Morgan. The former was cut to
pieces in the inner court. Upon the Restoration one of the regicides
was confined for 25 years in a chamber we saw. Southey wrote some
pretty lines enough on him.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The party reached Ross on the 20th, having come through
Chepstow and Monmouth.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span></p>

<p><i>21st.</i>—Went to the churchyard, from whence there is a celebrated
view, which, however, I think little of; the walk in it is shady and
pretty. 21st, came through Hereford to Foxley. At Hereford D. of
Norfolk insisted upon our giving him one day. 22nd, 23rd, stayed at
Foxley. The General was there. 24th, went to Ld. Oxford’s<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> at Eywood.
Charles unwell, and left at Foxley with Drew. 25th, stayed at Eywood.
26th, I returned alone to see Charles, and joined the whole party at
Downton Castle, Mr. Knight’s,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> in the eve. late. 27th, returned to
Foxley. 28th, came to this place, Holme Court, the D. of Norfolk’s.
Stayed yesterday, and go away to-day, 30th.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LADY OXFORD</div>

<p>Ly. O. has lost her vivacity and beauty. She is in a deplorable state
of spirits, proceeding, I fancy, from an enthusiastic, romantic
admiration of Sr. Francis’s ideal perfections. She fancies herself
a victim of sensibility, and is really so drooping that I should
scarcely be surprised if she perished from imagining grief. Mr. Knight
encourages her in those <i>bursts</i> of sensibility; he compares
her tears to April showers that sprinkle and revive the freshness of
the violet. Be the cause what it may, her beauty is impaired; her
eyes, which were always full and prominent, now from thinness start
out. It is also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span> probable that her languor may arise from having
lost the relish which the novelty gave of being a great lady. She
appears from an affectation of <i>naïveté</i> weaker than she is; in
a whining, monotonous, childish tone she uses fine phrases for common
conversation. She said to Ld. H. upon the Slave Trade, ‘I am always for
justice and humanity, ar’n’t you?’ And to the General: ‘In case of a
revolution, you, of course, would take the side of the people against
the King, would not you?’ The house is comfortable, and they live with
a degree of splendour they are unequal to, as he has ruined himself by
his ostentation and her total ignorance of the value of money.</p>

<p>Mr. Knight wrote a famous work upon the traces still to be found in
Italy of a primitive worship. He has assembled a large collection of
these symbols in bronze, marble, etc. He is a passionate admirer of
the ancients, and studies in nature antique forms and contours. Ly.
Hamilton was his favourite; she absent, the admiration is transferred
to Ly. O. He is a middle-aged man, and has a large fortune. His
pursuits are classical even to pedantry. He has made a good house and
fine grounds, and lives with a degree of luxurious <i>recherche</i>.</p>

<p>The Duke of Norfolk<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> is an extraordinary instance of the
impossibility of <i>situation</i> being sufficient to secure happiness:
he, however, finds in his own good temper an antidote to all the
vexations of his life. He has all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span> that rank, dignity, and wealth can
give; he married a beautiful woman whose person he liked, possessed
of 15,000<i>l.</i> pr. anm. About eight years after she became mad,
and from being intestate her immense possessions escheat to the Crown,
there being no male heir to the Scudamores. It appears to be a hardship
that the laws afford no relief to a person united to one insane, as no
pretext can be more valid towards the dissolution of a marriage than an
obstacle of that nature that impedes the fulfilling of every function
belonging to the institution. He maintains with solid magnificence
the splendour of his rank; everything about him bespeaks wealth and
luxurious comfort. His servants are old domestics, fat, sleek, and
happy; his table is profuse and exquisite. His taste is bad; he loves
society, but has no selection, and swallows wine for quantity, not
quality: he is gross in everything. The Dss.’s madness has taken a
sombre, <i>farouche</i> turn; she hates all mankind. The clergyman
during a lucid interval advised her to read religious books, supplied
her with some, and mingled his advice with pious exhortations. She
acquiesced, and took the books. A few days after she returned them
with scorn, saying, ‘I wish I could believe your d——d trumpery, as I
should then be certain two-thirds of mankind would roast in H——! It
was curious that in the Gospels she could find matter to gratify her
malignity. The Duke behaves uncommonly well to her.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DR. INGENHOUSZ</div>

<p>Mrs. Clive, Ly. Plymouth’s sister, went there to meet me. She is a
shrewd, sensible woman. Her husband is a Jacobin of the worst sort,
envy actuating all his equalising principles.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Wm. Scott, Ly. O.’s
brother, another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span> Jacobin, was there: he is merry and good-humoured,
and tho’ a zealous disciple of Horne Tooke’s a few good briefs to get
him a <i>pied à terre</i> will cure him of his democracy. I knew him
many years ago at Nice. Capt. Morris,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> the famous singer of his own
witty songs, entertained us with some of them; he is drunken and dull,
and since the death of a favourite son, has renounced singing any of
his <i>light</i> songs. He made a superstitious vow to God Almighty
that he would not.</p>

<p>We slept at Gloucester on the 30th. On ye 31st passed through pretty
Rodborough Vale, and Badminton Park, not a fine place, tho’ large, and
arrived here, Bowood, 31st August, Saturday. Found Ld. Lansdown in
high good humour and cordiality with me, and in very good health and
spirits. The Smiths were just come from Warwick. Mr. Dumont is here,
and two or three other indifferent people. Poor old Ingenhousz is dying
rapidly. He is shrunk to a skeleton. Ld. L. with great humanity and
feeling affords him an asylum, which his other friends were averse to,
as the beholding of a dying man is a painful spectacle. He talks with
intrepidity of death, but, <i>hélas!</i> where can the courage come
from? The subject is a painful one.</p>

<p>Dumont and I walked every morning, that is to say, the three I stayed,
in ye garden: his conversation is always amusing and instructive. We
talked over books that we each liked, especially Bonnet’s beautiful
work, <i>Contemplation de la nature</i>, which contains many
interesting expositions of the wonderful economy of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span> nature in the
structure of plants and animals. Had he not too frequently allowed
his imagination to run off with him when he turns to the attributes
of the divinity, he would tire less, but his apostrophes which aim at
sublimity are generally incomprehensible and bombast.</p>

<p>Whilst I have been travelling I have not been idle in the way of
reading; we have read already ye first seven volumes of Henry’s
<i>History of England</i>. It is written upon a more extensive plan
than that suggested by Voltaire and partly adopted by Hume.</p>

<p>Of public affairs the changes have been so varied and rapid that it
is difficult to recollect the exact position of things. Bonaparte was
repulsed from before Acre, and obliged to return with a diminished and
dispirited army into Egypt. The circumstance the most humiliating is
that his great name should be coupled with that of the bullying bluster
of that charlatan, Sr. Sidney Smith, who has obtained the command of
some marines and gun-boats against him in Syria. How fickle is the
glory of a hero! That ‘... name at which mankind grew pale’ is now lost
in obscurity, and the events in the East, which occupied and tortured
the breast of every politician in Europe, are now so overlooked that
barely are they discussed in the survey of politics at present.</p>

<div class="sidenote">STATE OF NAPLES</div>

<p>In Italy Suwarrow and ye Austrians have driven out the French; the
Cis-Alpine district is returning to the dominion of its former
possessors; dear, pretty Florence is restored to its mild sovereign.
Lord Nelson has brought back the fugitive monarch to his capital, and
Naples now exhibits a scene of revenge, more bloody than the Sicilian
Vespers.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The hearts of Frenchmen are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span> brought as trophies to a
cruel people, who crouched in servile subjection whilst they were too
abject to fight their own cause. Ly. Hamilton has not been remiss in
adding her quota to the barbarity which enflames every breast. Rome is
yet without its Pontiff, and for the happiness of a large portion of
the natives of those happy climates it is to be hoped will for ever
so remain, as no one can wish to see the restoration of a government
founded upon the superstitions of mankind, and burthensome in itself.</p>

<p>An expedition into Holland for the restoration of the Stadtholder has
just been undertaken.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> It commenced ill; a fort was taken with
the loss of some officers and five hundred men. Since that the Dutch
fleet has surrendered, whether voluntarily or by the treachery of
its officers is yet a secret. The Duke of York is to go and take the
command. I don’t know how his presence will inspire courage to those
troops he absconded with so hastily but a few years back. The expense
is said to be so enormous that the income tax, which, by-ye-bye, has
fallen short of the calculation, will go to take a fifth, instead of a
tenth, of our incomes in future.</p>

<p>Left Bowood, Tuesday, ye 3rd; passed through a richly cultivated,
well-built, and populous vale to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span> Wincanton. Passed thro’ Longleat
and Stourton; slept at the first town, and arrived here, Sherborne
Castle, on Wednesday. It is an old Gothic mansion; the <i>corps de
logis</i> was built by Sir Walter Raleigh, who, if one may judge from
oral tradition, seemed attached to the spot, as there is a venerable
grove planted by his hand and honoured with his name. Upon his death
his estates were confiscated, and granted by the narrow-minded pedant,
who sacrificed to policy and intrigue his glorious life, to his
infamous minion Somerset. Upon his fall they were bestowed upon the
singular George Digby, Earl of Bristol,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> whose adventures form some
of the most diverting anecdotes in Clarendon’s history. It has since
remained in the Digby family. On the opposite side of the lake are the
ruins of the castle of Sherborne, held out by a lady of the family
against the dismantling summons of Cromwell. The ground is classic; an
eminence called Jerusalem Hill is crowned on the summit with a clump of
firs planted by Pope. He was a frequent inmate, and the friend of an
affectionate brother and sister, whose affection he has commemorated in
an epitaph in Sherborne Church.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD WESTMORELAND</div>

<p>We found only Mr. Hoare with Ld. Digby, a brother of Sr. R. Hoare,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
the owner of Stourhead, a handsome, gentlemanlike young man. The next
day Ld. Westmoreland<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> came. He is coarse in mind, manners, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
language. The first is overbearing and sanguinary; he appears to be
one who thinks strong measures indicate a strong mind, and that vigour
denotes intrepidity, whereas in my opinion the reverse is proved, for
genuine fortitude inculcates clemency. His manners are those that
spring from power engrafted upon a low education, and his language is a
symbol of both. I do not wonder he is accused of having sowed the seeds
of the late rebellion in Ireland; he seems of a character calculated to
irritate wavering loyalty into rebellion. He spoke so brutally of some
of the wretched prisoners who had escaped his fury, that my heart beat
high with indignation, and even <i>I</i> for a moment felt a movement
in behalf of a nation I never liked.</p>

<p>There have been a few newcomers every day; Mr. Newbolt came over to
see us. Yesterday Mr. Wingfield,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> who married Ld. Digby’s sister,
arrived. He is like Archibald Hamilton, who, by-the-bye, is now become
Ld. A. H.,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> in person, and unfortunately, in manner resembles Mr.
Chaplin,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> the same precise, deliberate way of speaking.</p>

<p>Since I have been here I have read a <i>Life of Voltaire</i>, written,
I believe, by Condorcet. It proves what I was not at all aware of—that
Voltaire was really persecuted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span> for his freedom of opinions, and that
a timely escape and concealment was necessary to save his liberty
at different periods. Absurd and unjust as most of the attacks are
against <i>philosophy</i>, as it is called, one must admit that those
free principles and the spirit of investigation which pervades all
Voltaire’s writings, tended very much to induce people to attempt
eradicating prejudices and making reforms before they had well examined
into the abuses or prepared a remedy against them. It is without an
example in the records of mankind that a single man, unaided by the
fanaticism of religious superstition, should have produced such a
change in the sentiments of a large bulk of Europe as Voltaire did:
one can scarcely say it has been for the better when the devastation
of France is now before our eyes. Whatever mischief may have arisen
from the freedom of discussion, I think many now living will outlive
the practice, as there is an anti-conspiracy to that of which the
philosophers are accused now making among the rich and powerful—one
that, if pursued with the ardour I see many enter into it with, will
inevitably be the ruin of all taste, literature, and civil liberty.
The young men of fashion and birth are bit with a military mania; they
all aim at attaining a martial air, and a reputation for strictness in
their Militia discipline. Without reflecting much, they are persuaded
a military force is necessary to keep the people down, and that as
religion is co-existent with the State, so it is wise to support
it even in its abuses. Fifty years hence I have no hesitation in
foretelling that there will be little toleration, a curbed press, a
great standing army, and what is called a <i>vigilant</i> government.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BOBUS SMITH</div>

<p>Poor Doctor Ingenhousz is gone for ever; he died last week at Bowood.
Ld. L., with his warm benevolence to those to whom he is attached,
afforded him every friendly comfort to the last. He did not shun the
sight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span> of a dying man, altho’ at his time of life the spectacle is
but painful to contemplate, as it brings to mind a crisis that to him
cannot be very distant. Ingenhousz was a Dutchman by birth; he was
first distinguished as an inoculator to the Imperial Court.</p>

<p>We stayed exactly a week at Sherborne; I passed my time agreeably and
left it with regret. I did nothing the whole morning but float upon
the water in a state of luxurious indolence. Ld. Digby told me he had
heard that Ld. Ossory had asked the Chancellor for a Commissioner
of Bankruptcy for Bobus.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> I can believe it <i>now</i>, tho’ two
years ago I was credulous enough to receive as sincere the fustian
declamations upon independence, and that a lofty, aspiring mind would
owe nothing to the influence of others; that it would extort reward by
its sole merit, and that the only check upon his felicity in uniting
himself to his antiquated wife was that her connections were great and
powerful, which, to little minds, might be supposed operated as an
inducement to the union.</p>

<p>Not, however, to speak fairly, do I think these motives actuated him:
I truly believe he imagined he felt the <i>belle passion</i>. Be that
as it may, I now think he is disposed to avail himself very readily
of any advantage those connections can procure him, for his whole
deportment recently demonstrates what is always said, ‘That no one
despises situation and family, but those who have no claim nor chance
of either.’ He reminds me of the old story of the opera contractor,
Gallini, who captivated a lady of noble family, Lady Betty Germaine,
and was astonished at hearing that his marriage with her did not
ennoble him, and that he did not legally become what he styled himself,
Ld. Betty Gallini. The alteration has not escaped the keenness of
Dumont, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span> observes that after a visit to Warwick Castle he is more
than usually inflated with dignity and a soaring spirit; he says the
<i>Lord-erie</i> of the coronets, escutcheons, towers, gateways, etc.,
at that place inspire him by anticipation with all the haughtiness he
will feel when he fulfils the dignities he expects to acquire.</p>

<p>Fifty thousand years, if so many were allowed, would not efface from
my mind the advice a man gave me about my poor little girl; he said,
‘Suppress her entirely; do not let her suffer in a pecuniary way. She
is not injured, as she is ignorant of what she loses. Success for
her is doubtful, and the misconstruction and chattering of the world
against her is certain.’ These worldly maxims revolted my feelings, but
convinced me he who could give them was made to thrive, and would not
kick at that stumbling-block in the road to ambition which throws many
off their course, called <i>genuine</i> honesty, as there is a material
difference in the essential properties of that quality. The one he
will make use of will help him on. Depraved as men are in a corrupt
state of things, they yet like the names of virtues as much as they
abhor the practice. La Rochefoucauld says, ‘L’hypocrisie est un hommage
que le vice rend à la vertu.’ I heard of Dr. Parr’s saying a thing to
Mackintosh that was more coarse than witty, but yet it was pointed and
quick. Mackintosh, in canvassing O’Coigly’s character, alluding to some
transactions, said, ‘That was shabby; besides, his confession proved
that he died with a lie in his mouth.’ ‘No, no, Jemmy, he was not
shabby, because he was an Irishman and <i>not</i> a Scotchman; he did
<i>not</i> die with a lie in his mouth, because he was a Catholic and
<i>not</i> a philosopher.’</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Leaving Sherborne they went to Saltram by way of Honiton,
Exeter, Ashburton and Ivybridge.</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">SALTRAM</div>

<p>This house (Saltram, Ld. Boringdon’s) is quite the best<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span> I ever
resided in. The apartments are numerous and excellent; they contain
many pictures, and some very fine. It is an immense pile of building.
The beauty of the view depends upon the tide, which when full is very
pleasing, Mount Edgcombe, Plymouth, etc. Switzerland, Italy, the Tyrol,
and Nice have rendered me difficult about picturesque and grand views,
therefore I am less inclined to be enthusiastic than most people.</p>

<p>Living in a house built and liked by the great Raleigh<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> brought him
more forcibly to my recollection. I turned over various histories to
obtain all I could relating to him,—<i>State Trials</i>, <i>Biographia
Britannica</i>, Gibbon’s <i>Memoirs</i>, Osborne’s detached remarks.
I stayed at Saltram till the 22nd September. Ye time slipped away
easily. Ld. Bor. was really happy at seeing us, and cordiality combined
with goodheartedness and temper are such excellent ingredients in a
character, that if there are any deficiencies they are overlooked. I
had the misfortune—and a most severe, heartfelt one it was—to lose
my faithful companion, my attached Pierrot.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> He died! I loved him
for his own merits, and was grateful for his devotion to me; indeed,
I am convinced that he could not have survived my loss. Ld. H. made
impromptu the following lines for his epitaph:—</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
   <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>Pierrot, of race, of form, of manners rare,</div>
        <div>Envied alike in life and death lies here.</div>
        <div>Living he proved the favourite of the fair,</div>
        <div>And dying drew from beauty’s eye a tear.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p class="p-left">He was the gift of Ld. Henry.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> He faithfully maintained the love for
me his master felt whilst living. Peace to them both!</p>

<p>I viewed the dockyard and Mt. Edgecombe from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span> it; I was too timid to
venture in a boat across the Hamoaze. Many people came to dinner;
Colonels of the Militia Regiments quartered at Plymouth, the celebrated
Tommy Onslow,<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> who was full of jokes and puns. Some are good; to me
he was entertaining, as I did not know his stock, but that is slender,
and they are often repeated. Seeing him but once or twice did not
exhaust them. Sir John Frederick<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> is a mild, gentlemanlike man; he
has the manners of a man of the world, pleasant conversation, and a
fair portion of information. Colonel Montagu<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> I saw but once. Ld.
Bor. announced him as a superior man, and I was therefore prepared for
something remarkable, tho’ his praises are often queerly bestowed,
frequently for the love of paradox, to surprise by admiring what others
disapprove. However, Col. M. appears to be clever: he launched forth
upon the topics he is <i>au fait</i> of, and during a three-hours’
assemblage of people at and after dinner he gave the natural history
of every bird that flies and every fish that swims. He is a man of
bad temper, nor does it sound creditable to him that none of his
officers speak to him, and they are upon the eve of bringing him to
a Court-martial. He is separated from his wife, and might inherit an
estate of his brother’s if he would be united to her; but the condition
is too hard, and he renounces the possession of a benefit <i>so</i>
encumbered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">DUKE OF SOMERSET</div>

<p>The Duke of Somerset<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> came over and stayed at two different times.
He would have liked to have made a longer visit, but his mother was
arrived at Plymouth, and she is a jealous bigot. He possesses a plain
understanding and a mind in a progressive state of improvement. He
reads and reflects and judges for himself, mixed with great diffidence
and caution. He has had no advantage from an intercourse with the
world. He lives retired, and it is quite singular to observe the
impression a common, sensible remark, which might be made by anybody,
makes upon him; he looks at one, pauses, and exclaims ‘Very true!’
in a sincere way, that manifests that he is struck with the justness
of the observation, and that he admires the sagacity of the person.
I perceived this during the conversation I had with him, and the
points that struck him were merely such as any person at all <i>au
courant</i> of common events would make, rather commonplace, tho’
true. His politics are just and temperate; his principles precisely
those of a reflecting man, not actuated by any party motives, viewing
things not men. He deprecates the inadvertencies of Opposition, as they
have rendered themselves so obnoxious that they are dreaded in the
country, and have been the means of throwing an unfounded popularity
upon King and Ministers. He feels the necessity of abridging the
power of the Crown, which he thinks has made rapid strides towards
absolute, independent Monarchy. The first step to be taken, he thinks,
is to obtain peace almost upon any terms, and the next to retrench
the dangerous extension of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span> prerogative this unfortunate war has
given to the King. He has a taste for literature, rather free upon
religious subjects, a great admirer of Gibbon—not his style, but his
sentiments; many passages he knew by heart and repeated, tho’ from
diffidence he could hardly finish a sentence, but that soon wore off.
He seems well-read in polemics, knew the arguments urged on both sides
in all the modern controversies, Parr, Travis, Curtis, Porson, Paley,
Gisborne, etc. Upon the whole, I should be pleased to improve my
knowledge of him. His brother<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> is a great mathematician and man of
science. He would not come, but proposed solving an abstract problem
with Mr. Playfair,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> which had occupied him for some days.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MR. DUGALD STUART</div>

<p>On ye 25th we arrived here, Bowood, where we have found a numerous
party. The Archbishop of Bordeaux,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> a man who practises the piety
and resignation his profession bids him teach. Tho’ fallen from a
high dignity which he supported with honour, he has not been heard to
utter an unavailing regret upon the past; he is truly respectable.
His Grand Vicaire, L’Abbé Landrecelles, is also entitled to praise
for his philosophy. Another Abbé, who is sensible, also was here.
Indeed, the whole class of clergy have alone distinguished themselves
by their conduct; they acted from principle, and are rewarded with
universal esteem and respect. Mr. Dugald<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span> Stuart<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> and his wife, from
Edinburgh, were here: he is reserved, and I did not hear him speak, but
he is supposed deservedly to enjoy a high reputation. She is clever,
well-informed, and pleasing.</p>

<p>I read Voltaire’s <i>Memoirs</i>, written by himself; I do not think
any of his works abound with more genuine wit. The whole narrative of
his connection with the King of Prussia is a <i>chef d’œuvre</i>, but
tho’ he tells his own story, yet it is evident that he was in the wrong
in their quarrel.</p>

<p>The Duke of York has met with a check in his attack on Alkmaer; he
seems to have quarrelled with Abercromby,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> as his official dispatch
is silent in his praise. I fear the whole expedition will fail, and
prove a useless waste of blood and treasure.</p>

<p>There is some perverse quality in the mind that seems to take an active
pleasure in destroying the amusement it promises to itself. It never
fails to baffle my expectations; so sure as I propose to my imagination
an agreeable conversation with a person where past experience warrants
the hope, so sure am I disappointed. I feel it perpetually, for
example, with Dumont; with him I have passed very many cheerful hours.
This knowledge tempts me to renew our walks, the consequence is we both
yawn. I can only account for it from a mutual effort to revive the same
topics, or that we both endeavour to infuse a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span> liveliness equal to
what we remember pervaded our past conversations; and where there is
labour there is always failure. It is now got over; we have ascertained
that we each vary in <i>agrément</i>, either from condition, weather,
or other circumstances; and we have made up our minds to it, and are
four times in five highly gratified. I am convinced there is a period
in all intimacies where that feeling takes place. I am so persuaded of
the impracticability of arranging, ‘<i>Now</i> we will be pleasant,’
that I shun settling a meeting: chance does favourably what method
would destroy. He possesses a fund quite inexhaustible of amusement,
literature, anecdotes, lively observation, disquisition upon grave
subjects; all this combined with a good heart and temper. He spends
his leisure too much upon an occupation that I should doubt repaying
him with fruit equal to the labour. He is translating and elucidating
a metaphysical system upon legislation, jurisprudence, etc., of
Bentham’s. His imagination appears better calculated to adorn the
<i>belles lettres</i> with just criticism than to define the Penal
Code. But no person of abilities finds out exactly their excellence.
Boccaccio despised the only work which makes him immortal. He never
showed his friend Petrarch his <i>Decamerone</i>, tho’ upon second
thoughts Petrarch must have known parts at least of the work, as he
tells him in their letters he frequently reads <i>Griselda</i>, but
never without shedding tears. Beautiful as the <i>Griselda</i> is in ye
Italian, I am almost disposed to prefer our Chaucer’s English version;
there is a pathetic simplicity that touches the heart. The expressions
are very natural where one can understand the language.</p>

<p>The day before we left Bowood Mr. Jekyll came. He is never so pleasant
where Ld. L. is, as elsewhere; he aims at being the grave senator, and
becomes pompous, didactic, and, with his merry little figure, one may
add ridiculous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">MR. FOX’S ACCIDENT</div>

<p>On Tuesday we left Bowood. Our long conversations and disputes upon
Stonehenge and the Druidical worship made us desirous of seeing that
remarkable place: we therefore went by it to London. It is, to be sure,
a most wonderful edifice, let it be raised by who it may. I shall
transcribe great part of the description of its situation, etc., from
Gough’s edition of Camden’s <i>Britannia</i>.</p>

<p>We arrived that night at Basingstoke, and arrived here on Wednesday.
We found Ste. in perfect health and spirits; he is fat and ugly, but
very merry and strong. His head is beautifully shaped; his ears are
as pretty as his father’s; he will be darker than Charles. In the
eve. Ld. H. went to see his uncle Mr. Fox, who was confined in town
under the care of two surgeons. A gun burst in his hand and shattered
his fingers. There was for some time a danger of his losing one of
them. Hamilton came and stayed a night. There is a great perplexity in
the family about his brother’s name, whether it is to be Douglas or
Clydesdale.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> The Chancellor has started the difficulty, but Scotch
etiquettes are a <i>mer à boire</i>. The late Duke made no will, but
left bonds to a great amount, for which his personal property must
answer; thus the fine pictures at the Palace of Hamilton will go to the
hammer. There is no danger of Ld. Stanley claiming the dukedom.</p>

<p>I went on Thursday to the play; General Fitzpatrick came with us. Sr.
Lionel<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> dined with us on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span> Saturday, and Hamilton. On Sunday, General
Fox.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> He is going immediately to Minorca, where he is appointed
Governor. His wife is not to accompany him now; she imputes her not
doing so to Sr. James St. Clair’s pompous dispatches, in which he
announces the intention of the Spaniards to attack that place, a vapour
to give himself importance.</p>

<p><i>10th October, ’99.</i>—On Monday last Ld. H. moved for leave to
bring in an Address to his Majesty upon the Russian Treaties;<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
consequently the House is summoned, and to-morrow he is to bring it
forward. He is extremely nervous, not having spoken in public for some
months till the other two days last week. The Treaty for ye 17,000 men
employed in Holland contains an article contrary to ye constitution:
‘His Majesty <i>engages</i>, in case the troops should be compelled to
leave Holland at a season when the Baltic is frozen over, that they
shall pass ye winter in England.’ This article is a direct violation
of the laws, and without precedent. He means to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span> introduce at the same
time a wish that measures may be taken to manifest a desire of peace.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EXPEDITION TO HOLLAND</div>

<p>Alkmaer is taken with a great loss of men; the details are not yet
come. Tierney was here this morning in a sort of perplexity at a
suspicion of Nepean’s,<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> the Under-Secretary of State. It seems that
in a private letter from General Coote to Sr. Charles Grey<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> the
<i>truth</i> is told of the conduct of the Russians, who absolutely
refused to advance, throwing themselves flat on their bellies and
declaring they would not stir. This letter Tierney saw, and it was
known to Nepean that he had seen it. Combining that with Ld. H.’s
motion to-morrow, they feared this circumstance would be made public,
and Sr. C. Grey came to town this morning, in a fright, to explain
matters. The fact is, Ld. H. knew nothing of the affair till to-day,
and at Tierney’s request from Sr. C. G. of course will not make any use
of the knowledge.</p>

<p><i>11th October, ’99.</i>—On Wednesday, 9th October, Ld. King<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
passed the day and dined. He is young and handsome. His political
principles are strongly anti-Government; his liking to Ld. H. makes
him act with him, tho’ his opinion disposes him to exceed the limits
Opposition have drawn to themselves; <i>pour trancher le mot</i>,
he is what is called a Jacobin. His dislike to what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span> is established
is more against the Church than to the State: he quite abhors the
Christian religion. He has a considerable share of information in
theology, metaphysics, and political economy. Seeing him but once
sociably, I cannot accurately estimate his worth. He is a most
affectionate, excellent son. He came to town on purpose to second Ld.
H. to-night. Tho’ he is not a remarkable speaker, yet he is stout,
and Ld. H. expects to find a consolation in having him; as any person
who is warm on the same side must be a relief from the <i>agony</i>
of a solitary opposition. Yesterday I had a visit from a strange man,
a Dr. Hager;<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> he was employed by ye King of Naples to detect a
literary fraud in Sicily. One of the impostures was a supposed Arabic
translation of all the works of Livy containing the lost books: this
curiosity he discovered to be an ingenious fabrication. The other was
some grants to the Church during the period where there is a hiatus
in ye Sicilian history. His head is crammed full of metaphysics and
erudition, to the total exclusion of every particle of common sense. I
could perceive <i>rays</i> of <i>illumination</i> about him, when he
talked of his admiration of truth and the necessity among enlightened
people to substitute a moral catechism for <i>that</i> built upon the
credulity and superstition of mankind. His <i>generous spirit</i> of
converting those misled by error, alias religion, will involve him in
scrapes should he not be wiser before he publishes in this country, as
I suspect it has done already in Germany. He is one of Ld. Wycombe’s
strange men; he picked him up in Sicily.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD AMHERST</div>

<p>Amherst came; I complimented him upon his speech. He seconded the
Address.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> He was sure to do it with propriety, therefore a
congratulation was safe; as he is as certain of not exposing as he
is of not distinguishing himself. He has a good heart, with a narrow
mind; of all the young men he is the most <i>borné</i> in point of
intellect. Nature seems to have determined upon confining him within
<i>proprieties</i>. He was born to be a courtier, to live upon the
terrace at Windsor, and wear the uniform; beyond that he will never
get, unless Canning may want a <i>tête-de-perruque</i> to fill up a gap
in any motley Administration he may have the forming of hereafter.</p>

<p>Tierney spent the whole morn.; I am very happy to discover that he
has dropped the folly that made him tiresome and ridiculous this
summer. To-day Mr. Grey came to assist Ld. H. in some calculations and
in drawing up the Address; he is very pleasing when at his ease. We
laughed over Tierney’s unsteadiness; one day his determination to make
motions upon every great question, the next his <i>abattement</i> and
timidity. Grey told a good answer of Mr. Beddinfield’s to Dundas. A few
years ago the mob attacked ye King’s carriage and were going to commit
some violence. Mr. B. was in the park; he immediately pulled out a
pistol, and dispelled the rioters. The next day Dundas asked him what
he would have bestowed upon him as token of favour. He said, ‘I wish
only, Sir, that you would make me a Scotchman.’</p>

<p>He read the surgeon’s letter giving an account of his brother’s wound;
the ball went through the knee, and was extracted from the hollow ham
within. It seems to have been an escape. Grey was going over to see
him, unless this good report had come.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, October 13th, ’99.</i>—Ld. H. made a motion for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span> peace. He
was satisfied with himself, especially in his reply to Ld. Grenville.
From his account I should fear that, tho’ it was able, it was too
personal.</p>

<p>On that very night came the news of the strange reverse the Allies have
experienced, 19,000 Austrians and Russians captured and slaughtered,
Zurich retaken, and many other places in Switzerland; Hotze, the
Austrian General, killed;<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Suwarrow had crossed the St. Gothard to
relieve that army, and when they were defeated he was advancing to
assist. Ld. Macartney has just brought me the further news, which is
that the cruel, bloody Suwarrow is totally defeated and probably taken
prisoner. The monster who in cold blood cut the throats of women and
children in Warsaw and the suburbs, and who exceeded his orders to make
them more barbarous at Ismail, will not excite my pity even under the
most rigorous captivity. There let him groan. The day of retribution
ought to be in this life, to convince one that punishment is not
withheld to a dubious period. These famous Russians, who have been so
puffed since they have been subsidised, turn out to be the only fit
food for powder, as nowhere do they fight; in Italy all the glory of
the expulsion of the French from thence is due to the brave Austrians.
Thus has this mighty horde of barbarians dwindled to a handful of
tattered, ill-disciplined, worse-officered, half-starved savages.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PARIS FASHIONS</div>

<p>Ld. Macartney was present at the debate; he said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span> Ld. H.’s reply was
excellent, that it proved him to have very superior abilities, but he
altogether disapproves so much of the line he has taken that he cannot

When he is Bonaparte’s prisoner it is to be hoped he will assist
him to correct his narrative of the affair of Acre, as Sr. Sidney’s
rhodomontades do not accord much with probability. It was an unnatural
state of things that Bonaparte should have for a moment such a buskin
hero for a competitor; whilst he was eclipsed, one might say:—</p>

<p class="p-left">I went yesterday morning to see a milliner who is just arrived from
Paris; she brings strange dresses and fashions, and some sumptuous,
costly to a degree that she cannot get a purchaser. She complains that
a Deputy’s wife at Paris spends more upon her attire than a duchess
does here. She has veils that cost 50 guineas, morning head-dresses 20,
and so on in proportion. She says Paris never was yet at such a pitch
of luxury and <i>recherche</i> in dress as at present.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, 19th.</i>—On Sunday last Mr. and Mrs. Stuart and Dr.
Hager dined here. On Monday we went to the play with the Stuarts.
On Tuesday Ld. Macartney, Calonne, James, and the Fish dined, very
tolerably pleasant. On Wednesday I went to see Mr. James’s pretty room
and fine books; he has given in to the luxury of splendid editions,
broad paper, and sumptuous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span> bindings. The collection is as complete
as possible for the sort of thing, but the expense is enormous, and
hardly answers in point of enjoyment, tho’ one is not sorry to see fine
specimens of the various arts of printing, papermaking, bookbinding,
etc., etc. He has contrived to spend 5000<i>l.</i> upon articles that
lie in a very small compass.</p>

<p>The Bessboroughs, who have just returned from ye Isle of Thanet,
dined with us; they brought Ld. Boringdon. There was besides Mr. Wm.
Smith,<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> an Irish orator, who made a fine speech and wrote a good
pamphlet in favour of the Union. He is uncommonly bashful, an infirmity
not peculiar to his nation, but one which impedes his being reckoned as
able as he is to common observers.</p>

<p>The whole Dutch expedition has failed, and the troops are coming back
forthwith, tho’ there are great apprehensions entertained as to their
being able to withdraw without immense loss; they calculate upon
losing their rearguard of 3000 men.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Out of evil there is good:
Lds. Morpeth and G. Leveson had offered their services, and were upon
the point of going. Ld. G. is raising a regiment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span> and is appointed
Lt.-Col. I am sorry he throws away very excellent abilities upon a
profession where so little is required—at least, as it is practised in
this country; and I believe as a good patriot one ought to hope it may
for ever remain as insignificant as it has done hitherto. Parliament is
adjourned until January. We went to the play, Tierney, Mr. Hoare, and
Capt. Murray. Confirmation of the French accounts of the losses of the
Allies in Switzerland, etc., etc.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PRICE OF SUGAR</div>

<p><i>Sunday, 20th, ’99.</i>—The whole day I was confined to my own den
by a most villainous cold. After we had finished our dinner Ld. Morpeth
came to dine. He arrived in town only the preceding evening.</p>

<p>The immense price of sugar has defeated the avarice of the proprietors
of it; various experiments have been made, first, to extract sugar
from saccharine vegetables, and then to grow it in different climates.
In Prussia they obtain 8 lbs. weight of good sugar from 100 lbs. of
beet root. In America a settlement called the Notches, above the river
Ohio, has grown a large quantity from the sugar cane. The price is only
kept up by some commercial artifice winked at by the Government. The
revenues of the West Indians will be considerably diminished, and tho’
I ultimately may suffer I confess I should feel very little sorrow if
they had been at 0 for the last four years; then <i>he</i> would not
have added another example to the many—that injustice thrives.</p>

<p><i>25th, Friday, Money Hill.</i>—On Sunday, 20th, Curran<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> dined
with us. He was intimidated at the sight of the tables as he passed
through the room, and told Mr. Tierney he feared he should not be able
to speak. He kept his word, as he did not utter three sentences during
dinner.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span> We had, besides, Mr. Grey, ye Bessbro’s, Mr. Weld, Mr. George
Ponsonby<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> (the Irish orator), and the Duke of Bedford. On Monday Mr.
Wm. Smith, the Irish Unionist, Mr. Hoare, whom I knew at Sherborne, and
Calonne. Calonne slept. He gave us a most interesting narrative of the
assembling of the Notables, and many particulars of the latter event
during his Administration; if ever I have patience I believe I would
detail the account. We went the next day to Money Hill, where we found
the Smiths. They stayed till Thursday, on which day Ld. Bor. came. He
went on Friday; we returned home on Saturday....</p>

<p>On Tuesday the Beauclerks went. She wished very much to stay, as her
health required repose; the motion of the carriage disagrees with her
always, and she was not recovered from the journey of the day before.
This consideration, added to her being far advanced with child, had
no effect upon Beau.; he was positive. I fear he is disposed to be
peremptory in trifles. I do not like to give way to all my fears upon
the score of his temper, but she is all sense and gentleness. Ld.
Morpeth and Dumont dined, a very pleasant dinner. Ld. M. stayed, and
<i>cause’d</i> late; Dumont slept. Ld. M. is very amiable in a small
party, where he is quite at his ease.</p>

<p>Bonaparte is returned with his staff to Paris. The cause of his return

<div class="sidenote">A MIXED PARTY</div>

<p><i>7th November.</i>—I have just begun La Harpe’s <i>Cours de
Littérature</i>; they are lectures upon <i>les belles lettres</i>,
delivered at the Lycée. On Friday, 1st Nov., a remarkable pleasant day,
Ld. Ossory, Macartney, Morpeth, Calonne, Fish Craufurd, Tierney. The
youth of Ld. M., and the Jacobinism of the latter did not promise to
accord with the years and gravity of the rest of the party, but the
singularity gave a zest, and everybody was delighted. Tierney won so
much upon Ld. Macartney, that I am sure he might be made coadjutor to
any outlandish embassy Ld. M. may be appointed to: he boasts of being
<i>homme à tout plat</i>. Ld. Ossory was very happy, notwithstanding my
Lady’s prohibition of his being so within these walls.</p>

<p>The Smiths came in the evening. We were to have taken them next day
to my mother’s in Suffolk, that Mrs. S. might visit her father at
Newmarket, but during the night Ld. H. was seized with some sharp
twinges of the gout, which obliged us to delay our journey, much to my
disappointment, as by it I lost the sight of my dear little Harriet.
Saturday alone with the Smiths. Sunday Dr. Hager came; Smiths went
away. Ld. H. continued ill; not so bad as the fit last autumn. It is
curious that the pain seized him almost the day twelvemonth.</p>

<p><i>10th Nov. Sunday.</i>—The failure of the Dutch expedition has
created at the time a great sensation, but the public mind is absorbed
in the expectation of another enterprise upon the French coast. All
parties disclaim having projected it. Pitt’s friends say it was all
Dundas’s scheme; he again lays it to the Queen and Princess of Orange;
and they to the <i>map-makers</i> for placing dry land where there
ought to be swamps. The only person who uniformly disapproved of the
undertaking was the Stadtholder.</p>

<p>Public affairs everywhere have assumed a gloomy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span> aspect. The badness of
the season has destroyed the corn in many counties, and the increased
price of provisions in the setting in of a threatening winter announces
misery to the wretched poor and perhaps no small clamour from them, as
certainly the corn sent to Holland must have taken considerably from
the stock here, besides that the transports employed to convey the
troops were chiefly North-country colliers. Thus the price of coals is
at an unknown height, 60 shillings the chauldron. (In December 1799, 6
<i>guineas</i>.)</p>

<p>I have been reading <i>Joseph Andrews</i>. It is, in point of interest,
inferior to <i>Tom Jones</i>. There are scenes where the wit is even
more excellent, but the <i>nature</i> of his characters are sacrificed
to a love of buffoonery. Parson Adams is frequently put into situations
so extravagant that the ludicrous is destroyed by the impossibility
of the events. Fielding had a model, his tutor, a Dr. Young,<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> who
was full of learning and simplicity. There is a story of him whilst
he was chaplain to one of the Duke of Marlborough’s regiments. The
enemies were encamped near each other expecting to be engaged; the
<i>distrait</i> chaplain walked out, and was so absorbed in the perusal
of his <i>Æschylus</i> that he passed the lines. A sentinel seized him
for a spy, and carried him to the general. During his examination he
stated so naturally that without thinking of anything one foot followed
the other, and brought him without his knowledge where he was, adding
that he assured his Excellence he was no spy. ‘Ah, mon ami, I sincerely
believe you. The D. of M. ne vous aurez jamais choisi pour espion, mais
vous resterez dîner.’ He was sent off, fully acquitted of the suspicion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CALONNE</div>

<p>I have endeavoured to persuade Calonne to write his <i>Mémoires</i>.
Even those of his own life would be interesting;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span> but the period of his
Administration, and his generous sacrifices to the Princes subsequent
to their emigration, would fill up a period in the history of the
Revolution which can only be well done by him. He set the best machine
of revolt in motion. His own story is that when at the head of the
Finance he found that for many years the expenditure of the Government
had exceeded its receipts, and that Necker’s <i>compte rendu</i> was
a false assertion upon false fact: that to remedy this deficit he had
persuaded the King to let him propose an equal taxation to the Noblesse
and Clergy; that the Queen also was got over, till the night before he
was to make his speech to the Notables, when she joined the faction
headed by the Archevêque de Sens.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>A <i>bon mot</i> of Mirabeau upon him. He was a rash, impetuous man,
without conduct or judgment. ‘L’Archevêque de Sens est toujours hors de
son diocèse.’</p>

<p>I am reading the Arabian History in the most methodical way, too
laborious to continue. I read Marigny, and refer to Ockley, the
<i>Universal History</i>, and Gibbon. The latter I shall read when I
have finished the others, because to read Gibbon one must understand
the history he writes of <i>à fond</i>—at least so from his summary
way of describing one should infer he thought it necessary for his
readers.</p>

<p>Sunday, we had a very pleasant party, Hare, Fitzpatrick, Ld. Robert,
Mackintosh, Mr. Scarlett, Smiths, Dumont. Mackintosh talked very
pleasantly: his efforts to please were guided by good taste. His memory
is very correct and retentive; he illustrated literary criticisms
with lively quotations, particularly from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span> Burke and Gibbon. Mr.
Scarlett<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> is a rising man at the Bar; his profits are more upon
the circuit than in the King’s Bench, but when Erskine and some few
of the monopolists are removed he will distinguish himself there. He
has an uncommonly benevolent countenance; his heart seems full of
mild virtues; tho’ very unassuming, he yet is agreeable in a mixed
conversation. Smith’s boisterous yet superior intellect did not
dominate; Hare’s keen wit and the General’s discerning taste subdued
his usual propensity to overpower with clamour and dispute for victory
alone. He was temperate and entertaining.</p>

<p>Hare was in full glee; they had all dined at the Lord Mayor’s Feast the
day before. Combe<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> is an Opposition man, and the <i>patriots</i>
were received with acclamations in the City; Fox was dragged by the
populace, so was the Duke of Bedford. The whole civic festival went off
with triumph to the <i>party</i>.</p>

<p>Whitbread, the <i>arch-seceder</i>, is disposed to return to his duty
in Parliament, and measures are to be taken to persuade Mr. Fox to
do the same. God knows whether they will succeed. It is a matter of
very little consequence whether they do nor not, as the prejudice in
the country is too strong to be conquered even by the misconduct and
failure of Ministers. The General stayed all night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">DUMONT</div>

<p>This morning, Monday, 11th, Dumont left. I was sorry to lose him, as
he is <i>facile à vivre</i> and full of amusement to me. He is very
universally liked by all who have the least relish for literature and
good conversation. We had rather a motley mixture at dinner: Hare,
Fitzpatrick, General Dalrymple,<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Capt. Murray, and the Duke of
Bedford. The latter is in very bad health; his spirits are visibly
affected. On ye 12th the General left us to make some alterations at
Sunning Hill; Hare, only, to dinner. On Wednesday Ld. H. went out for
the first time. Lewis dined: he repeated some verses he wrote this
last summer in Scotland, ‘Reflections in a Royal Burying-ground.’ They
are the best of his, quite in a grand style; there are parts full of
philosophy and feeling. In the evening a very comfortable gossiping
coze with Hare.</p>

<p>The price of porter is raised; the augmentation has been admitted
without clamour. Every article of <i>first necessity</i> is alarmingly
dear.</p>

<p><i>14th Nov., ’99.</i>—I continue reading the Arabian history with
interest, especially in Ockley, whose style is plain and manly, tho’
criticism might be busy detecting vulgarisms. A comical observation
of Gibbon’s upon himself in his <i>Memoirs</i> just occurs. He
says, ‘Ye year 1770 was particularly favourable to the growth of my
<i>intellectual</i> stature.’ The expressions are uncommonly ludicrous,
combining it with the recollection of his misshapen, grotesque figure;
for he was a monster, and so filthy withal that one could not endure
being close to him.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Tierney, Dumont, Sr. Lionel, and Hare to dine; very lively
and pleasant. Tierney bore a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span> equal share in the task of amusing
with Hare, who is unique in excellence.</p>

<p>Friday alone. Saturday Mr. Morrice came to stay. Went to the play,
where I gained a violent <i>migraine</i> and additional cold; brought
the Smiths home.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, 17th.</i>—Sick with headache. Hare to dinner, Duke of
Bedford, Robinson, Major Hare, Hare’s son. Laughed so immoderately
at Hare’s liveliness that my head was much worse, and I went to bed
seriously ill. The Duke of Bedford looks infinitely better. I am in
great hopes he will recover. He is in better spirits.</p>

<p><i>12th January, 1800.</i>—A variety of little circumstances and
frequent illnesses have prevented me from continuing regularly my
notes. I went in the course of the month of December to Dalham.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> I
saw my dear child. Mrs. Smith went with us. Our visit did not exceed
four days; we returned by the way of Cambridge, Ld. H. Petty and Mr.
Debarry dined with us there. I was curious to ascertain whether the
Gothic architecture of Henry VII. [<i>sic</i>] chapel would please
me now, as it did many years ago, long before I saw the wonders of
Italy: I found time and comparison had not in the least diminished my
admiration of it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NAPOLEON’S LETTER</div>

<p>Bonaparte returned suddenly from Egypt to France. He has overthrown
the Directory, and the then form of Governt., and established a
constitution at the head of which he is placed as Grand Consul. Should
it be a permanent usurpation I will learn with accuracy the outlines,
but the revolutions have been as variable as chemical nomenclature or
systems of metaphysics. He opened a negotiation for peace lately by
writing a letter <i>directly</i> to the King: his offer was rejected
upon frivolous and peevish pretexts. The reply was made in the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
barbarous language, crabbed, ungrammatical, and incomprehensible.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
The joke of the day was that each of the Ministers who were present
contributed their phrase: Mr. Pitt, ‘ye limited possibilities’; to Mr.
Windham, ‘the line of hereditary Princes’; Ld. Grenville, ‘rapine,
anarchy, and plunder’; nor were Lds. Westmoreland and Camden forgotten
by giving ‘their explicit acquiescence’ to all that was done.</p>

<p>I went to a Harlequin farce on ye 28th December after dining in
Cavendish Square; a gun was fired off, which frightened me, and on the
morrow I was taken ill. I was very weak and confined to my bed many
days; this day is ye 13th, and I am still indisposed.</p>

<p>During my confinement I have been reading among other things multitudes
of novels, most of them sad trash, abounding with the general taste
for spectres, hobgoblins, castles, etc., etc. Godwin has added to
his publications; critics say, not to his reputation. In his preface
he announces that he has not abided by the principles contained in
his <i>Political Justice</i>, as he throughout the work shows that
the greatest calamity is to loosen the ties of social confidence and
domestic love.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Poor Mr. Weld, who dined here occasionally, dropped
dead at the Tower, playing at whist with Ld. Thanet. He died under
great pecuniary embarrassments. Marsh came to us the first day of
the vacation; Ly. Lucy and the Dss.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> were in the house, but it so
happened by Ly. L.’s illness and sure management on our part that they
never met.</p>

<p>A <i>polacre</i> conveying dispatches from Alexandria to France was
taken off Toulon, carried into Minorca, and the dispatches, which did
not sink when thrown overboard, have been forwarded by General Fox
to the Governt. They contain minute details of the military colony,
and complaints of their being in total want of ammunition, etc., etc.
The official letter is from Kléber; he conveys a sort of censure upon
Bonaparte for his having quitted the army. He encloses Bonaparte’s
letter to the army upon his quitting Egypt, in which various reasons
for his departure are given; among them is <i>l’obéissance</i>. There
is also a letter from the <i>Contrôleur des Finances d’Égypte</i>. He
complains bitterly of the difficulty in levying the taxes, and the
stubbornness of the Turks, who, sooner than pay will submit to stripes
and even death. These letters and many private ones are to be made
public and commented on by the mild spirit of Mr. Gifford.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> They
will be published in a few days, before the meeting of Parliament, in
order to give the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span> proper cue to those country members whose warlike
spirits may have been subdued at the sight of the universal suffering
throughout the country—a suffering aggravated, if not caused, by the
horrors of war.</p>

<p>There can be nothing more contemptible than the personal pique all
Ministerial people seem to feel towards him. The object in publishing
these letters is merely to gall him by an expression or two, and for
this gratification they shabbily put in the names of individuals, which
may be the means of much private ruin. They say, ‘Aye, this will do him

<div class="sidenote">LORD ANDOVER’S DEATH</div>

<p>Poor Ld. Andover!<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> Unfortunately, in giving his gun to his groom
the piece went off, and the whole contents were lodged in his body:
he retained his senses 7 hours after the accident, and died shortly
after. His wretched wife! What must her feelings be! Each most tenderly
attached to the other. It is the only tie which when dissolved makes
the vast world a wilderness. How can piety, fortitude, or reason bear
up against such a dreadful calamity? Indeed, one cannot wish it should
prolong the existence of the miserable relict. That direful separation
alone can shake the love of life so deeply rooted in us all. Canning
says Ld. Andover used to remind him of Ld. H. at times. Great heavens!
how far beyond a remedy must be her sorrows. Without knowing any of the

tears of unfeigned pity from my eyes; how fortunate for her should she
never awaken to her wretchedness, but die in the agonies of delirium.
Oh! in mercy let such be my close if I am doomed to the—oh! I cannot
with calmness suppose the case.</p>

<p>Ye Friday party<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> did very well, dissimilar as are the opinions of
the parties. On Saturday Ld. Wycombe brought a Spaniard,<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> who is
just come from Paris, and is in England without the knowledge and
against the consent of the Ministers. He has resided in Paris during
the last four years, and he has adopted the principles of Revolution
<i>con amore</i>. He calls the Church Establishment an infamous
institution, and appears quite ripe to back his principles by his
practice.</p>

<p>Mr. Fox was persuaded to come and attend the House of Commons on the
day the subject of the negotiations was discussed. He always must speak
well, but I should have preferred an oratorical, philosophical survey
of the events that had arisen during the secession to a mere debating
speech, which he made.</p>

<p>The intercepted letters are published with a preface avowedly by
Canning; the notes are certainly by another hand. During the debate
which Mr. Fox attended Canning launched out with his usual flippancy
of tongue against the D. of Bedford, and said he would not lose his
time in replying to arguments brought forward from a man of <i>such</i>
an intellect. Fox gave him the retort <i>un</i>courteous and made the
little great man shrink. In going out he asked him if he seriously
thought he could persuade the country that the D. of B. was an idiot.
‘No, I don’t; but why did he attack my publication?’ ‘My publication!’
And such a thing it is; the prophecies announcing the Messiah could not
usher him in with more awful pomp than he does these letters to the
notice of the public.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD KING</div>

<p>It was lucky that the first time Mr. Fox heard his nephew speak,
should be when he spoke the best. Tho’ his terror was excessive, yet
he possessed himself, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span> made upon the subject of the negotiation a
very able speech. On the Dutch inquiry, moved by Ld. H., Ld. King spoke
uncommonly well. Ld. H. was the more pleased, as it was merely out of
friendship to him that he prevailed upon himself to conquer his dread
of addressing a public assembly. He is a very young man, very handsome,
very awkward, and very shy, but very full of most excellent qualities.
He is a good son, a warm and generous friend. His principles, political
and religious, are inimical to the actual state of those in force. The
first are moderated: he was a lover of liberty even to democracy, and
still abhors religion to impiety, but the experience that has corrected
him of one excess will cure him of the other, and doubtless he will
become very like other people.</p>

<p>When the division was coming on, Ld. Liverpool and Ld. Malmesbury
and many others called out, ‘Pooh, pooh! you won’t divide! Why, you
will have but three. Pooh, pooh! Don’t think of it!’ ‘Aye, but I will
divide!’ cried Ld. H. ‘If I am single I will have a division’; when, to
his great surprise and pleasure, the Duke of Somerset and Ld. Mansfield
divided with him, besides King and Bessborough. Ld. Camelford did the
same, but pique against Ld. Grenville explains his conduct.</p>

<p>From several conversations I had alone this summer with the D. of
Somerset I collected that he was, tho’ not disposed towards Opposition,
yet averse to Ministers. He is a sensible man, inclined to act upon
his own judgment: his manner, from shyness, is against him. I suspect
that he has a love of fun in him, for he told me that he was occupied
in persuading Lewis to write a book on moral philosophy, as he was
certain from the opinions he heard from Lewis that it would be at least
entertaining. ‘For,’ says he, ‘he calls <i>virtues</i> what the world
holds in abhorrence as great vices, and these paradoxes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span> he maintains
so strangely that I cannot illustrate them stronger than by telling
you that he confesses himself surprised that Wilberforce should have
published his book after <i>The Monk</i>. He thinks it great want of
taste to give a system of morality in a dry, forbidding form, whereas
“<i>mine</i> is given in a popular, pleasing manner, which diverts
whilst it instructs, annner to upbraid him for his vote the night
before, but hed is adapted to every capacity.”’ Yesterday when he
came in to dinner Lds. Boringdon and Amherst lifted up their hands in
a ma rather showed an unwillingness to be tutored. Again, during a
dinner, Ld. B. leant across me to tell him he was a rival to Julian.
I immediately said, ‘I see no apostasy in being guided by good sense
and not biassed by interest.’ Ld. B. said no more, and the Duke looked
thanks for the reproof. Again Ld. B. asked how he meant to vote upon a
question which is coming on. The question is improper to ask, and the
Duke replied very well, ‘I shall decide when I hear the arguments on
both sides.’</p>

<p>We had a numerous party; Sir James St. Clair is lately returned from
Minorca, of which place he gives but a sorry account. His wife is
handsome; she did not love him when they first married, but his good
nature has conquered her dislike, and she is almost in love with him.
In most marriages a material change occurs in the course of ten years,
but she has the merit of <i>singularity</i> in hers. Ld. Lorne is an
old favourite of mine; his good humour, cheerfulness, and ease is quite
charming. Lewis’ lines in an epilogue to <i>Barbarossa</i>, which they
acted at Inverary, are very descriptive of him:—</p>

<p>
And Lord Lorne’s easy air, when he got in a passion,
Proved a tyrant must needs be a person of fashion.
He seemed much at home through the whole of the play;
He died in a style that was quite <i>dégagé</i>.
And his orders for murder, disclosed by their tone,
’Twas the same if he gave them or let them alone.

fool and his money are soon parted.’ Most of his is squandered at the
gaming table, Newmarket, rare editions, sums lent to ——, splendid

very good-natured, and not conceited—merits that cover a thousand

<div class="sidenote">MR. KINNAIRD</div>

<p>A few days back Mr. Kinnaird,<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> eldest son of Ld. Kinnaird, dined
here for the first time. Being a Scotchman and having studied in a
Scotch University, report puffs him high, of course. Tho’ it overdoes
his deserts, yet he merits some praise. He is clever and willing to
please; one cannot pity him for <i>shyness</i>, as he labours under
no embarrassment upon that score. Living in the world will set his
head right and render him useful. He is an eager politician against
Ministers.</p>

<p>Ld. H. is gone down to the H. of Lords, as a message from the King
to subsidise the <i>German</i> Princes is before the House. It is
conjectured that our magnanimous ally, the Imperial Paul, is deserting
the cause he espoused so vehemently; whilst we are to continue fighting
until ‘experience and the evidence of facts’ render a peace proper with
Bonaparte. One of the finest passages in Mr. Fox’s speech was where he
took up the expression of those who gave for reason the not negotiating
immediately, that ‘we should <i>pause</i>.’ He described with energy
the calamities of war, the villages sacked, cattle destroyed, the field
of battle covered with agonised victims weltering in their blood, who,
if questioned as to the cause they were fighting in, could not answer
as in other wars, ‘ambition,’ ‘aggrandisement of territory,’ etc.,
etc.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span> ‘No, we fight because the English Ministers are doubtful as to
the moral qualities of Bonaparte.’</p>

<p>Lord Carlisle is mightily disposed to vote against the Ministers, a
propensity which gives his son great alarm, as he is riveted to all the
dogmas of the Ministerial creed, the necessity of the war, faith in the
prowess of Suwarrow, the infallibility of Mr. Pitt, etc., etc.</p>

<p>General Fitzpatrick has published his letters to Lord Kenyon.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
Previous to doing so he sent them to the King, accompanied by a letter
calculated to delight him, appealing to him as the head of the school
of honour and chief among gentlemen. The motto to the publication
is very happy; it is taken from Kenyon’s own speech on the trial of
Horne Tooke in 1792: ‘Mr. Horne Tooke, I cannot sit here to hear names
calumniated and vilified, persons who are not in this case, persons
who are absent, and cannot defend themselves. A Court of Justice is no
place for calumny. You must see the impropriety of it, and it does not
become the feelings of an honourable mind.’</p>

<p>I heard of a great trait of Scotch nationality. At a dinner at the
Chief Baron’s,<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> where Sylvester Douglas<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> was, the news, just then
fresh, of Bonaparte’s seizure of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span> the Governt. was mentioned, upon
which both the Scotchmen at the same moment inquired, ‘And what did
Macdonald<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> do?’</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PRINCE’S HEALTH</div>

<p>The Prince of Wales is supposed to be dying: whatever his illness may
be besides, revived love for Mrs. Fitzherbert has aggravated and added
to the measure of it. Mde. de Coigny says it’s like a <i>rondeau</i>,
in which variations are made <i>ad libitum</i>, but the return is to
the first air. He had a numerous dinner last week, composed solely of
parsons; whether this was fun or fear is uncertain. If he had been in
a vein for the former, it might have been indulged, as no set of men
abhor each other with more heartfelt hatred than those pious brethren;
each is in the way of the other, like an overloaded market in Bengal of
English beauties. The other night at D. House he fell back in his chair
and pointed to have his neckcloth loosened; fortunately Farquhar was
there, and ordered proper remedies for his recovery.</p>

<p>The French have played a very good trick in return for our publishing
the intercepted letters. They pretend to have found hidden in the
wall of a house belonging to a Chouan chief, letters written by Pitt,
Windham, etc., to recommend the Royalists to make peace with the
Republicans at any rate, and then break it when the English succours
arrive. This may be a <i>real</i> correspondence, but if not, <i>è bene

<div class="sidenote">COMTE D’ARTOIS</div>

<p>Tierney told me of a circumstance which had been conveyed to him
<i>from authority</i>. At one of the dinners given by the Comte
d’Artois to Pitt and the Cabinet Ministers, the Cte. expressed his
astonishment and indignation <i>to</i> Pitt, that a man possessing such
principles as Mr. Tierney does, and uttering all that his turbulent
and discontented disposition gives rise to, was allowed to go about;
that such a man in a well-regulated Governt. should be confined, and
not allowed to be at large to preach politics. Pitt replied that
Mr. Tierney was a member of Parliament, a very loyal subject, and
respectable in his private character. This was said drily, and intended
as a reproof to a very ill-judged question. Nothing could show a
greater want of taste and knowledge of English customs, than to abuse
a member of Parliament to the Prime Minister of England, and tho’ I
would not detract from Mr. Pitt, yet his defence of Tierney was such
as the occasion extorted, and ought to have been made for any man in
Parliament who has not outraged the laws. Even Sir Francis Burdett is
as yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span> entitled to a similar justification. The Cte. d’Artois (at
present, according to the <i>ancien régime</i>, Monsieur) is a man of
slender abilities with violent passions; before the Revolution he was
weak and volatile, he is now weak and revengeful.</p>

<p>Bonaparte gives fresh proofs every day of his talents for governing,
both in his disposition to conciliate and resist. He has issued letters
to recall most of the emigrant nobles who have not borne arms against
their country, infants, women, and priests; he manifests a strong
determination to fight as well as he did formerly, and not allow of
anything being wrested from the nation.</p>

<p>There is upon record a very curious fact, that well considered might
abate the ardour of those who are disposed to fight on for the
Restoration ‘of the line of Hereditary Princes,’ as it shows that that
event would not in all probability induce France to fall back within
her ancient limits—one of the objects proposed by the restoration of
ye Bourbons. Upon the restoration of Charles II., the Spaniards applied
to the English Court for the surrender of Jamaica, upon the ground of
its being conquered by an usurper.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> The English Ministers submitted
the question to the ablest civilians in the country, and they were
unanimous in their opinion that whatever conquest had been achieved
by the arms of G. Britain, whether under lawful or usurped authority,
<i>that</i> acquisition, once annexed and become an integral part of
the Dominion, it was safe to maintain even by force of arms. And can
it seriously be supposed, first, that the French nation will ever
receive a Monarch forced upon them at the point of the bayonet by the
allied armies, knowing that the incentive that provokes those allies is
the partition of France? And, 2ndly, admitting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span> the restoration were
practicable, would the Kings, whose object would be popularity, venture
to dismember their country? Why, even the unhappy emigrants, starving
and exiled, feel triumph and exultation at every victory obtained by
their countrymen.</p>

<p>Washington died towards the close of the year 1799. His name will
stand high in the page of history, and posterity will be apt to
outstep truth to bestow enthusiastic eulogy upon him, who has been
great from his mediocrity. Mankind delight in assigning deep designs
to very obvious facts. We shall hear of his being the first among
generals, legislators, patriots, and practical philosophers, of his
integrity, his disinterestedness in sacrificing to the public, of his
well understood ambition in preferring a <i>splendid obscurity</i> to
elevated insignificancy; in short, what will not be said except the
truth—a plain, painstaking, plodding man, whose profession of land
surveyor taught him a smattering of mixed mathematics which became
useful when military positions were to be conceived, a mild, even
temper, that neither offended nor captivated. So much will be said,
and hitherto so little has been said, that I shall wait and hear. All
France and America mourned at his death.</p>

<p>Canning sent to beg we would fix a day that he might dine here. He
came, we had only Lds. G. Leveson, Boringdon, and Ly. Bess. Went off
very agreeably. He was witty upon the new Institution,<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> which is a
very bad imitation of the <i>Institut</i> at Paris; hitherto there is
only one Professor, who is a jack-of-all-trades, as he lectures alike

<div class="sidenote">HORNE TOOKE’S ELECTION</div>

<p>When Horne Tooke harangued the electors of Westminster from the
hustings he was often put out by one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span> the mob closing his sentences
with a nasal ‘Amen.’ This ridiculous finale did him more mischief
than all the arguments of his adversaries to prove his incapacity, on
account of having taken Priest’s orders, and now the Bishop of London
refuses to induct him because he is a layman. He is ingenious enough, I
doubt not, to reconcile these seeming contradictions.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>Marquis de la Rivière<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> has with a degree of superabundant loyal
zeal, vexed me. At dinner here he overheard me telling Calonne the
story of the Cte. d’Artois asking Pitt why a man like Tierney was
not shut up. He straight went and asked Monsieur if it was true;
he, of course, said <i>no</i>, and contradicted it plump. This
contradiction Rivière believes implicitly, and wrote me a formal
denial of the charge. This provokes me, as I hate being made a party
in a <i>tracasserie</i>, and still more hate having named any person.
However, the thing is of no importance, because I certainly credit
Tierney’s statement in preference to Monsieur’s asseveration to the
contrary.</p>

<p>I was childish enough last night to go and see the new play; it was
almost my first <i>sortie</i> from my couch,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span> but I am not punished for

my box; he is the only person I give leave to enter at all times. He
was just returned from Cambridge, where he had heard Ld. Henry Petty
deliver a declamation, composed in the very best taste, full of feeling
and ingenuity.</p>

<p>I have been reading Le Brun’s journey to Persepolis in 1704, the ruins
of which (Persepolis) seem equal to anything of antiquity in point of
solidity, size, and extent.</p>

<p>In future times when this little island shall have fallen into its
natural insignificancy, by being no longer possessed of a fictitious
power founded upon commerce, distant colonies, and other artificial
sources of wealth, how puzzled will the curious antiquary be when
seeking amidst the ruins of London vestiges of its past grandeur? Acres
now covered by high, thin walls of brick, making streets <i>tirés à
cordon</i>, divided into miserable, straitened, scanty houses, will,
when decayed, crumble into a vast heap of brick-dust. No proud arch
to survive the records of history, no aqueduct to prove how much the
public was considered by ye Governt., no lofty temples, no public
works! St. Paul’s anywhere would be a grand edifice; finer as a ruin
than in its present state, disfigured with casements, whitewashed
walls, pews, etc. The bridges alone would strike the eye as fine
remains; they are magnificent. The reason of the meanness of everything
throughout England proceeds from two causes. One is the scantiness of
materials for great works, viz., stone and marble; second is, that
commerce begets independence, from whence springs selfishness and the
wish to enjoy what you acquire. Hence there is no ambition, no desire
of perpetuating by great works fame to posterity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE HUMANITARIANS</div>

<p>Hobhouse,<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> who dined here last week for the first time, is a
leading man among the Dissenters. He and Mr. Wm. Smith have written
controversial books, and he has distinguished his own sect by the
denomination of <i>Humanitarians</i>, not to be confounded with
Unitarians. Priestley, in fact, is the founder of their doctrines,
which doctrines they say are drawn from the New Testament in conformity
with the primitive practice of Christianity. They assert that most
points of faith in the Established Church proceed from the corruptions
of Christianity. Christ they believe to have been the son of Joseph
and Mary, but that he became inspired by a divine gift. They deny
the Trinity, original sin, and the soul; their paradise is composed
of material objects, not admitting the separation of soul and body.
The Bible they hold to be an historical chronicle, Moses merely a
legislator, the Prophets inspired darkly announcing Christ.</p>

<p>Sheridan by chance dined here on Friday, with a whole troop of
Frenchmen. I was afraid he would be annoyed, as he does not speak
French (which is the strangest thing imaginable for a man in his
situation), but he, on the contrary, was pleased with his party. The
company were ye Archevêque de Bordeaux, Calonne, Rivière, and Mr.
Lattin. He was diverted at seeing the Archevêque laugh heartily at some
sallies which might have shocked a bigot or a prude.</p>

<p>Crébillon Père, when upon his deathbed, sent for his son. ‘Ah! mon

behind his pillow a crucifix, and pointing to it, ‘Vous voulez donc<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
détruire ce qu’il lui a tant coûté pour établir?’ This story Condorcet
used to be very fond of telling.</p>

<p>Lady Ann Hatton speculates upon marrying Lord Abercorn. Lady
Bessborough, who is all credulity, believes <i>de bonne foi</i> that
this marriage will take place; even I, who am incredulous, have doubts
in his favour, provided what I am told is true, such as, that Ld.
A. has taken his daughters to visit their future mother. Beauclerk
thinks Ly. Ann dreams, and imparts the vision to Lady B. for facts.
Ld. Morpeth behaves admirably, but has wisely not given in a <i>contre
projet</i> to the project upon the <i>tapis</i>. For a moment I thought
the marriage story with Ld. A. was a scheme to obtain a real one from
him, but <i>nous verrons</i>. Tho’ I do not particularly like Ly. Ann,
I shall be glad to see her rescued from the humiliating state she is
in; neglect, poverty, and discredit are horrid sufferances. If she
closes her career with one of the greatest matches in the kingdom, I
don’t know how young women will credit wise precepts of ‘virtue alone
is rewarded,’ etc. She is 36, her appearance is so youthful that no
one guesses her to be above 24, if so much. Her figure is light, airy,
and graceful; Hare says she has a sort of vivacity that raises your
expectations, but what she says is so flat that it damps curiosity.</p>

<p>Bonaparte allows of the return of the emigrants; I almost fear he
extends that indulgence too far. Once restored to their possessions
they will long for their titles, and a King will be the fountain of
honour. The Duc de Liancourt has obtained all his estates which were
not sold, and those of the Duc de la Rochefoucauld; this makes him
among the number of the richest individuals in Europe.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">TALLEYRAND’S SARCASMS</div>

<p>A very profligate man, who was an agent of the Duc de Richelieu in all
his vicious debaucheries, said in a company one day where Talleyrand
(L’Évêque d’Autun) was, how much he was injured by the calumnies
propagated against him, ‘Et vraiment je n’ai jamais fait qu’une
méchanceté de ma vie.’ Talleyrand, with calm indifference, replied, ‘Et
quand finira-t-elle?’ I rather think the man’s name was Rulhière.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>Talleyrand is remarkable for his cold sarcasms. When M. de Narbonne
was Minister at War, Mde. de Staël was his protecting mistress, she
guided everything; and one day at a Council of War, at which, very
improperly, she was present, each Minister gave their opinion upon the
different projects proposed for the plan of attack by some generals.
She delivered, among the rest, hers with great warmth and decision;
when she had finished she turned to Talleyrand, and said, ‘Why, you do
not say a word! What do you think?’ He coldly replied, ‘C’est que je
ne m’y entends nullement dans les affaires militaires.’ This bitter
reproof vexed her to a degree of passion that she burst into tears; she
merited the chastisement, for ‘qu’avait-elle à faire dans ce galère-là?’</p>

<p>An excellent pamphlet, called <i>Observations upon the Preface to
the intercepted correspondence</i>, contains some witty and severe
strictures upon Canning’s highly absurd arguments contained in said
preface. It has been imputed to Grey, Lds. Wycombe, Holland, and to
Tierney. Ld. H. admired it so much that his uncle Fitzpatrick said he
could not resist telling him it was his, but it is a profound secret.</p>

<p>Mr. Fox is employed in writing the history of some late period in the
British annals, but whether King William’s reign or Charles II., I am
not certain, but I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span> rather believe the latter.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> I sent him by his
desire some books upon the subject, Ld. Grey’s narrative of the Rye
House Plot, Baxter’s <i>Life</i> of himself, and I have proposed to him
various other miscellaneous tracts. A philosophical history from such
a pen will be beyond praise, but I much fear his habitual indolence
will interfere too much to allow a shadow of hope that he will finish a
section even.</p>

<p>Ld. H. has a quality in common with him that is very serviceable in
many ways—a great enduring patience in listening to the arguments of
any fool, however great, and of always doing his best to answer them;
of never allowing himself to feel, ‘Why exert myself for this fellow?’
Fox says he always likes to hear the opinion of a fool, as he gets by
it two opinions, that of the person who gave him the opinion, and his
own as he adopts it.</p>

<p>General Smith lost a great deal of money at Brookes’; to dissipate
his chagrin he walked about the room, and at length joined in a
conversation upon religion. ‘For my part,’ said he, ‘I cannot
understand what they mean with their <i>Trinity</i> and <i>Holy
Ghost</i>.’ ‘I wonder at that,’ replied General Fitzpatrick, ‘as the
symbol is a pigeon.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">GENERAL FITZPATRICK</div>

<p>The General is less remarkable for brilliant repartees than Hare, but
all he says shows a profound knowledge of the world, life, manners,

conversation and writings remind me of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span> Addison. Leave out the morality
and piety, and the two characters are the same: mild, gentlemanlike,
and each possessing chaste humour. The General is by far the better
poet of the two. I am told that my taste is corrupted by that which
prevails, but I think energy of expression is oftentimes wanting in
both of the above styles.</p>

<p>North,<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> the Bishop of Winchester’s son, Ld. H.’s old friend, brought

<p>Bread is 17 pence the quartern loaf, coals six guineas the chaldron,
turkeys 16 shillings, capons 8s. 6d., meat dearer than usual. During

of the H. of Lords; each person in the family is limited to a quartern
loaf per week, no pastry, no fine bread for breakfast.</p>

<p><i>19th March, 1800.</i>—A satirical poem called <i>The Campaign</i>
is just published; it abuses the Duke of York and the Dutch Expedition.
It is imputed to Mr. Courtenay,<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> an old member of Opposition, a
man of great coarseness, but some wit. In the House of Commons some
supporter of Mr. Pitt’s Administration complimented him on having
conducted the machine of Government with such success, in spite of the
<i>drag chain</i> of Opposition. Mr. Courtenay, in his reply, remarked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
upon the beauty and correctness of ye metaphor, since the machine was
confessedly going downhill.</p>

<p><i>22nd March.</i>—Erskine and Mr. Lattin (and a foolish, handsome
Irishman, Mr. Henry) dined, and were extremely entertaining yesterday.
Erskine, I have always found hitherto far from agreeable, but yesterday
was an exception. He talked strangely upon religion; he pretends to
Christianity, but the Mother Church would not take him into her bosom.
Bishops and churches, he declares, have destroyed true religion;
had he the power of Christ he would drive the <i>doctors</i> out
of the <i>Temple</i> as he did, and out of Lincoln’s Inn besides.
The Church Establishment he maintains to be the total ruin of the
simple, primitive worship. The Trinity he explains with ingenuity,
and reprobates the Incomprehensible Mystery of three separate and
individual persons.</p>

<p>The little Monk Lewis has behaved like a great fool, and made himself
highly ridiculous. He sent to the Duke of Somerset and desired he would
<i>wait upon him</i> the next day at 1 o’clock. The Duke obeyed the
summons, and <i>did wait</i> upon him. ‘I understand, D. of Somerset,
that you have exposed me to the contempt of being again blackballed by
the New Club. I think the part you have acted by so doing unbecoming
the character of a friend; thus I desire our acquaintance may drop
here.’ He rung the bell, and bid the servant open the door for the D.,
and thus dismissed him. The D. of S. is remarkably good-natured, and
most certainly did what he thought Lewis would like, but, poor little
man, he is very irritable and quarrelsome, and will shortly be left not
only friendless, but without many acquaintances.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ROYAL INSTITUTION</div>

<p>This Institution<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> of Rumford’s furnishes ridiculous stories. The
other day they tried the effect of the gas,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span> so poetically described
by Beddoes; it exhilarates the spirits, distends the vessels, and,
in short, gives life to the whole machine. The first subject was a
corpulent, middle-aged gentleman, who, after inhaling a sufficient
dose, was requested to describe to the company his sensations; ‘Why,
I only feel stupid.’ This intelligence was received amidst a burst
of applause, most probably not for the novelty of the information.
Sir Coxe Hippisley was the next who submitted to the operation, but
the <i>effect</i> upon him was so <i>animating</i> that the ladies
tittered, held up their hands, and declared themselves satisfied. The
experiment to remove the popular prejudice in favour of silver teapots
failed, as the thermometer gave the lie to the Professor’s learned
dissertations, but it must have been from the malice of his evil
genius, for the fact is in his favour.</p>

<p>The Bishop of Killala’s<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> narrative of what passed in the town and
neighbouring district whilst the French were in possession of it in ’98
under Humbert, is extremely interesting. It is written simply, with a
great appearance of truth and feeling. His palace was the headquarters
of the General and his officers. He speaks with highest admiration of
their humanity, civility, and incredible discipline. There is even
humour in his description of some of the scenes, particularly that
in which he describes the mixture of mirth and contempt with which
the French officer thrust indiscriminately upon the noddles of the
Irish the gaudy helmets. He yields the palm of superiority to the
English for their <i>dexterity</i> in pillaging and in plunder; indeed
compared with every European army, save the Papal one, it is the only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
<i>excellence</i> in candour we can admit them to lay claim to.</p>

<p>Great embarkations are making at Plymouth of the Guards and other
troops. Their destination is not known, but rumour says they go to the
Mediterranean. Were I not satisfied how <i>harmless</i> an English
military force is against an enemy in battle array, I should wish
contrary winds to waft them leagues out of their course, if they are
destined for Egypt; but they inspire as little alarm to their enemies
as they do confidence in their countrymen, for they are, as one of
their commanders in Ireland said publicly of them, ‘Formidable only to
their friends.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">PICTURES BY VAN DYKE</div>

<p>This house<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> has contained many remarkable and interesting persons;
there are curious stories about its origin. Some say it was a nunnery,
others, that it was built by a <i>Cope</i> in the reign of Philip
and Mary. It came by marriage into the possession of Rich, Earl of
Holland.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> He was a most accomplished and gallant cavalier, and so
amiable that Charles I. conceived a jealousy against him, probably not
totally without foundation. In consequence of this he was confined
by order to his house, but his Royal mistress refused to cohabit
with the King until her favourite chamberlain was at large. During
his residence here Van Dyke passed a year with him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span> and probably
painted some of those portraits which now decorate most of the best
collections in England.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> There is a very fine portrait of ye Earl
of Holland, done by this celebrated artist, in the possession of Lord
Breadalbane, at Taymouth.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> It represents him in the prime and beauty
of manhood, arrayed in the apparel of a bridegroom, such as he was when
he represented his Royal Master at the Court of France to the lovely
Henrietta Maria. His left leg is covered with white satin, it being the
one put into bed to the bride when Royal marriages are made by proxy.
He held employments of considerable trust, but was accounted wavering
in his politics and irritable in his temper. He retired here just when
the Civil war broke out, in disgust. Clarendon says, ‘He was visited by
all the disaffected Members of Parliament, who held frequent meetings
at Holland House.’ Some time after, when the Civil war was at its
height, he offered to join the King’s party at Oxford, but being coldly
received he returned to the Parliament forces. On 6th August, 1647,
‘The Members of Parliament who were driven from Westminster by tumult
met General Fairfax at Holland House and subscribed to the declaration
of the Army, etc.’<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Some ascribe his desertion of the Royal cause
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span> his hatred of Ld. Strafford. He gave a proof of his wish to restore
it; in consequence of which he was taken prisoner, confined to his
house, and dragged to execution the 9th of March, 1648–9. His body
is buried in Kensington Church. In the July following, Lambert, then
General of the army, fixed his headquarters here. It was restored to
the family of Rich. When the Puritans shut up public theatres, the
actors used to act at the houses of the nobility, and this house is
mentioned as having frequently been the scene of much dramatic mirth
and festivity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ADDISON</div>

<p>Addison was tutor to the Earl of Warwick.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> He married the Countess,
his mother, a marriage which made no addition to his happiness; it
neither found them nor made them equal. She always remembered her own
rank, and thought herself entitled to treat with very little ceremony
the tutor of her son. Rowe’s ballad of despairing love is said to have
been written either before or after marriage upon this memorable pair,
and it is certain Addison has left behind him no encouragement for
ambitious love. There is a pretty little poem by Rowe upon the occasion
of his first visit to Holland House to see the Countess of Warwick.
It is said by some author, “Holland House is a large mansion, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
could not contain Mr. Addison, the Countess of Warwick, and one guest,
Peace.” During his residence here the house was frequented by the wits
and poets of the time, Pope, Tickell, Steele. Upon his deathbed he sent
for Gay, with whom he had had little previous intercourse. He told him
he had injured him, but would recompense him if he recovered: ‘What the
injury was, he did not explain.’ Lord Warwick was a disorderly young
man, and had received without heed the advice of Addison, who used his
utmost to reclaim his morals and mend his life; when he found himself
dying he sent for him, ‘That he might see how a Christian can die.’<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
He expired under this roof in 1719.</p>

<p>In 1762, Henry Fox, Secretary of State (afterwards Lord Holland),
inhabited, and shortly after purchased this house.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> During his life
it was frequently the resort of the great politicians. Sir Robert
Walpole, unless he died before, was certainly a frequent visitor, at
least he was a friend; Lds. Bute and Chatham, etc. Lady Sarah Lennox
resided with her sister Ly. H.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> at the period of the present King’s
love, a love that might have elevated her to the throne, but for her
levity and total disregard for appearances. Both Ld. and Ly. Holland
died here. During his long illness he one day forbade admittance to
all his friends who might call, with the exception only of George
Selwyn, ‘For if I am alive I shall be very happy to see him, and if I
am dead he will be very glad to see me,’ alluding to George Selwyn’s
extraordinary passion for beholding death in any shape. He rarely
missed the sight of an execution. He was supposed to have incensed
George II. extremely by having indulged this curiosity about Queen
Caroline, to obtain a sight of whose corpse he concealed himself under
the bed, and during the absence at night of the attendants examined the
body. George II. had such an aversion to him that he always called him
‘<i>That rascal George</i>.’ Selwyn once overheard him and exclaimed,
‘What can that mean? Rascal! Oh! I forgot that it was a hereditary
title of the Georges.’ The King (George III.) the year after he had
been at G. Selwyn’s house at Matson (famous in history for the escape
of Charles I.) went mad. G. Selwyn upon this observed, ‘that it was odd
enough that the only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span> two Kings that had visited Matson had <i>both
lost their heads</i>.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD ABERCORN’S MARRIAGE</div>

<p>This singular marriage of Lady Ann’s is going on rapidly, nay, the
nuptials are to take place in the course of this week; but till the
holy knot is tied, I confess such mystery hangs upon the affair that I
shall continue withholding my full belief. He consults Ly. B. about the
equipages, fêtes that are to be given upon the occasion, etc., and yet
insists upon her keeping her promise of secrecy, and even goes so far
as to beg she will contradict the report if she hears it. He was always
supposed to be a little cracked, and his pride is beyond belief. When
travelling in Italy during the life of his uncle and he was only Mr.
Hamilton, to distinguish himself he left upon his cards, ‘D’Hamilton,
Comte Héréditaire d’Abercorn.’ His language is so <i>outré</i> from
the manners of common life that it would appear caricatured and
<i>chargé’d</i> even upon the stage. Should the union really take
place, the first step will be a rupture between Ly. Ann, his daughters,
and Miss Copley their aunt, as Ly. A. is both violent and peevish, and
little disposed to submit to the <i>gêne</i> of <i>bienséance</i> with
regard to them.</p>

<p>I hear from my dear Webby frequently. The others I know are well, but
poor Harriet is placed in a cheap school, and will be educated among
people and with ideas that certainly are not adapted to her way of life
I hope and trust in future.</p>

<p><i>17th April, 1800.</i>—Abbé de Lille to-day shone. He aimed not at
proving himself a political prophet: he contented himself with being
a pleasant companion and a poet unique. In conversation he was very
amusing; he told several stories about Voltaire, with whom he had
been intimate in the early part of his life. The Collège de Montaigne
was remarkable for its filthiness; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span> <i>régent</i> of it, when the
<i>écoliers</i> were to act a play, was puzzled at their choice. It
was <i>Mérope</i>. The female name offended him, and he altered it to
<i>Méropus</i>: upon which Voltaire said it was in compliment of the
place to call it <i>Mère au puce</i>, it being the <i>foyer</i> of
dirt. Necker’s conduct in France, he said, was exactly like that of a
<i>Curé</i>, who at a jovial dinner heard the bell ringing to Vespers,
upon which he immediately chanted the Psalm of <i>Deus in adjutorium
meum intende</i>, etc.; the people made the response <i>Gloria Patri et
Filio et Spiritui sancto</i>; a man next to the <i>Curé</i> gave him a
<i>soufflet</i>, saying if he had not begun the people would not have
sung. The application to Necker was that he first sounded the alarm
and roused the people of France. At the beginning of the Revolution,
when things that now seem insignificant were looked upon as of great
importance, two men were overheard talking of the calamities of the
country in the Thuileries. One said, ‘Ah! bon Dieu, c’est la fin du
monde.’ ‘Bah! bah!’ replied the other, ‘Comment donc, Monsr., il y a
des exemples?’</p>

<p>He recited his translation of the fourth book of the <i>Aeneid</i>; the
tender passages prove his ignorance of the sentiment he expresses. The
famous tirade is admirably rendered.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD ABERCORN’S MARRIAGE</div>

<p>Lord Abercorn’s singular union has at length taken place contrary to
every plausible speculation. A few days before it was declared he
confided to a friend his intended marriage, without naming the lady.
‘The world will be surprised, do not contradict the report, nor deny
it.’ As soon as the event was public the Queen sent Ly. Ely to Miss
Copley<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> to desire her to come to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span> Buckingham House. ‘I hear that in
consequence of this business, that you intend quitting Ld. A.’s house;
remember, Miss Copley, that the worse the affair is, the stronger is
the necessity of continuing with your nieces, and remember you have my
advice and sanction.’ This maternal, majestic speech had its effect.
Sir Lionel Copley told me both of these anecdotes.</p>

<p>The day of the marriage Ly. A. was sitting with Ly. Bess. talking of
the event that was fixed for 8 o’clock in the ensuing eve., when their
conversation was interrupted by the entrance of the porter to inform
them, ‘That Lord Abercorn had just called and left word that Ly. Ann
must make haste, as she was to be married at 4.’ This intelligence
<i>so</i> communicated surprised them, but compliance and punctuality
are indispensable qualities where Ld. A. is concerned, therefore they
obeyed. As soon as the ceremony was over, which was performed at Lord
Sudley’s,<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> Ld. A. made the Marchioness a low bow, handed his eldest
daughter out to his carriage, and went and dined with his own family,
whilst the Marchioness went and dined in Cavendish Square. He came with
a cavalcade of servants and <i>flambeaux</i> to bear off his prize to
the Priory.</p>

<p>He is haughty and capricious, with enough of vanity to make him do a
generous action, and with a dash of madness to make him do a lively
one. Ly. Bess. went down for a few days; she described an evening
between the new married pair, which was an exact reproduction of a
scene in <i>The Taming of the Shrew</i>. To cure a headache he made her
play blindman’s buff, and the more she complained the more violent he
made the sport. A person remarked the livery, which is the same as the
younger branches of the Royal Family, and said, ‘I suppose your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span> family
took it from them.’ ‘My family took it from them? No, it was the livery
of the Hamiltons before the House of Brunswick had a servant to put it
on.’ When he told the Dowager Lady Warwick that Sir Wm. Hamilton (her
brother) was to marry Mrs. Hart, and that <i>he</i> should give her
away, she said it was a disgrace to the family, but if done by any of
them the deed was fitted to the one who had the blot in his escutcheon
and a crack in his skull.</p>

<p>The Duke of Somerset is to marry Ly. Charlotte Hamilton;<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> his mother
withholds her consent. She is much older than the Duke. Her superior
coquetry has obtained the palm, for his love began with her younger
sister, Lady Susan.</p>

<p>A circumstance, half ridiculous, half distressing, embarrassed me last
Saturday at Lansdown House. I met an old lover whom I had not set eyes
on for 14 years; the last time I beheld him was when he solicited an
interview to propose marriage. His mode of making the overture was
singular at least. He began by approaching his chair close to mine,
and followed this close-quartering with an endearing embrace round my
waist; he then complimented me upon my love of literature, and said,
‘I love books as much as you do, and we may fairly hope to have a very
literary little family.’ Tho’ barely fifteen years old, the ridicule of
the man’s proceeding struck me so much that I could scarcely contain
my laughter, and my mother did for me that which my own timidity
prevented, for he immediately received his final <i>congé</i>. He used
to write verses upon me, and sent me a copy, with a dog, the turn of
which was that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span> as I was afraid of thieves this cur would protect me
until I ‘a bolder guardian took,’ meaning his precious self.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A FORMER SUITOR</div>

<p><i>22nd April, 1800.</i>—Ld. Thurlow yesterday in the House of Lords,
with every expression of contempt, animadverting upon the folly of
the Bills now brought before Parliament, the one for protecting bull
baiting, the marriage of a divorced woman with the culprit, etc.,
addressed himself sarcastically to Lord Auckland, and said, ‘And pray,
my Lord, why do you not bring in a Bill against ingratitude,’ alluding
to Ld. A.’s desertion of Ld. North.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> The reproof was coarse and
uncalled for. The Union was debated last night in both Houses. Mr.

<p>The above story of Ld. Thurlow’s sarcasm is murdered. The sting lies in
the absurdity of attempting to correct moral vices by law, which makes
the sneer wittier.</p>

<p>Ly. Ann’s change from poverty and dependence to stately grandeur
reminds me of the pretty <i>Epître des Vous et des Tu</i>, in which
Voltaire sketches the delights of his youthful mistress, contrasted
with the dull pomp she was surrounded by after a splendid alliance:—</p>

Austrians have just come to be dissatisfied at the augmentation of
17,000 efficient, hardy troops to their enemy just at the beginning
of the campaign. The magnanimous Emperor of all the Russias is in

of Sir C. Whitworth,<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> who has committed the unpardonable offence

Majesty has besides withdrawn his Russians in our pay. The high pay may
however tempt him to relent.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> About a month ago he sent to Mr. Pitt,
Ld. Grenville, and Mr. Huskisson, 3 crosses of the Order of Malta, of
which order he has constituted himself the head, altho’ one of the

Mr. Fox against his opinion and inclination. I conveyed to him very
cautiously, that his attendance, unless he had an explicit and a
sort of public declaration from Mr. Fox that he wished himself to be
considered as null, would not be looked upon as fair; he assured me
that Fox had oftentimes urged him to attend.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> I implied that such an
assurance was of course all his <i>conscience</i> could require, yet
that public opinion demanded more publicity to be given to the wish

he never could ask Mr. Fox to declare himself for ever withdrawn from

<p><i>5th May.</i>—Last week Ld. H. made a motion in the H. of
Lords in favour of the Catholics, to obtain what they call their
emancipation.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Lord Lansdown, like a sly old politician, was glad of
an opportunity of saying something on behalf of the Catholics, mingled
with a praise of the Union, so that should the Union fail, he may
say, ‘I foresaw that ye measure, without granting the Catholics their
demands, would prove a mischievous one’; and if it should succeed he
may say, ‘I supported Ministers on it.’ In his speech he made several
heartfelt compliments to Ld. H. He said that whenever he differed in
opinion from him he doubted the rectitude of his own judgment; for of
his excellent abilities, he added, the House were competent to judge,
but of the goodness of his heart those only who had the happiness of
knowing him in private could estimate the value. He went on in this
strain for near ten minutes. The whole debate was flat, none were
in spirits; Ld. H. was unwell, and more than usually chilled by the
deadness of his audience. Tierney declares that accustomed as he is to
act singly in the H. of Commons, yet he could not bear up in the H. of
Lords; there is a palsied indifference in the hearers that checks all
spirit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD LANSDOWN</div>

<p>It was essential to Ld. Lansdown to preserve the attachment of ——
during his Administration. But —— confided to Ld. L. that his health
was injured by an irregularity of life. One should have thought from
the austerity of Ld. L.’s manners and private character that he was
a singular person to select for such a confidence, but so it was.
‘Indeed, I am not surprised, the calamitous state of the country,
the imbecility of Ministers, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span> augmentation of the debt, and the
increased influence of the Crown is such that I own to you very
frankly for dissipation I plunge myself into the lowest debauchery.’
He then, after this prelude, administered friendly relief. This is
very characteristic of him; the sort of jumble of ideas, and the
overstrained civility of adapting his own conduct to that of the person
he wishes to please, however repugnant it might be to him in reality.</p>

<p>‘Comment, mon ami,’ cried a wife to her drunken husband. ‘Vous vous
perdez, vous laissez toujours votre esprit au cabaret.’ ‘Ne craignez
rien, ma chère, j’irais la chercher dimanche.’</p>

<p>People are very much occupied with this Divorce Bill.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Ld. H. has
felt a shyness in attending the progress of it in the H. of Lords.
A Bishop, full of the subject, last week began talking to him; he
expressed his approbation of its becoming a criminal proceeding, and
added, ‘And do you not think, my Lord, that it would diminish the
frequency of the vice, if parties were condemned to imprisonment for
five years?’ Ld. H. was, of course, puzzled how to answer. The Bishop
was B. of Chichester.</p>

<p><i>8th May.</i>—D. of Bedford, who is just returned to town, dined
here; Ld. H. was detained at the H. of Lds. Fortunately I had Francis,
and the day went off pleasantly. We talked of Mr. Fox’s history, to
which he has written the introduction. It was lamented that instead
of taking the period of which he could say so much from personal
knowledge, he should go to one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span> distant and well known. The Duke said
his reason was extreme indignation against Hume, whom he had been
reading last autumn; who very artfully pleads the cause of the House
of Stuart, and in a way to interest his reader about the private
virtues of Charles I., ‘Who, by-the-bye,’ added he, ‘is a most amiable
man when viewed in his domestic capacity.’ Upon this Francis, with
his usual impetuous vivacity, burst forth against him, denying him
every qualification that constitutes a gentleman or a man of feeling.
He quoted two stories out of Carte’s <i>Life of ye D. of Ormond</i>,
a writer who is allowed to have a strong bias to the Stuarts. One
was, that in the Palace at Whitehall there were etiquettes, ‘similar
to those established by that <i>fop Louis XIV.</i>,’ about certain
apartments, which could only be entered by men of distinguished
quality. Hampden, by accident, and through ignorance of these courtly
rules, got into one. Suddenly a noise announced the entrance of the
King; to conceal himself he sculked behind a screen. His friends
with whom he was conversing were in a bustle; the King upon entering
perceived their disorder, and insisted upon knowing the cause. He
explored behind the screen, and upon finding Hampden, he shook his
cane over his head, and threatened to beat him and worse, if he ever
broke through bounds again. The other was, his receiving a petition
on horseback, which was presented to him by Sir T. Fairfax and a
deputation kneeling; he made his horse curvet, kicked the knight, and
endangered his life. Clarendon’s style, he said, was <i>grave and
slow</i>. He told Dr. Parr here at dinner the other day that Swift’s
style was <i>clear and shallow, perfectly pellucid</i>. The fact is he
admires no style but his own, and that is worthy of admiration, as it
is much the best now.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NEW BILLS</div>

<p>D. of B. means to go down about this new Divorce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span> Bill; he is very
eager against it. He says it will reverse the present system, for if
a circumstance of the sort occurs to a husband who is high-spirited,
he generally fights the lover, whereas the lover will now threaten the
husband by saying, ‘If you make an <i>éclat</i> and get me whipped at
the cart’s tail, by G——, I will kill you.’</p>

<p>A Bill is to be brought forward in the H. of Commons by Sir H. Mildmay
to check the increase of Catholicism, by preventing the nuns at
Winchester from giving the veil. An attempt to make a proselyte will
become penal. Mr. Fox, when he heard of these Bills, the one against
celibacy and the other, said, ‘Aye, the poor women, they will not let
them do one thing or the other.’</p>

<p><i>11th May.</i>—Parr entertained us uncommonly; he was in full
force. We gratified him highly by going into the room into which he
retreated to smoke. His vanity is such that the slightest attention
elates him, and more particularly, when it comes from a person whom
he would denominate a woman of quality. Mr. Knight’s love of pedantry
got him too frequently upon verbal criticism, and when they did fall
upon a doubtful Greek word, they pulled at it like hungry curs. When
they returned to the library he talked upon literature. His praise
of Middleton’s style was that a man of strong feelings and vigorous
conceptions ought to study it to abate the ardour and rigidity of
style, and he recommended it to Bobus. He asserted that Middleton was
an unbeliever in Christianity, and read several passages, which put
it out of all doubt, from his <i>Defence of the Free Enquiry</i>. Of
Warburton he expressed the utmost admiration; his opponents, he said,
who had attacked him, were snarling hounds; ‘mine was the froth of a
mastiff.’ He said of Burke’s first book upon the French Revolution that
it was ‘the effervescence of rage’; the second was ‘the bitter sediment
of malignity.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span></p>

<p>On Tuesday I went to Money Hill; Miss Fox, Drew, and Charles went with
us. I returned on Friday. The two mornings I passed there we drove
about in the sociable to see the country.</p>

<p>We drove through Cassiobury, Lord Essex’s; to The Grove, Ld.
Clarendon’s, and so on to Russell Farm, the Ladies’ Capel. Pretty
ground and fertile country. Ld. H. fished, and caught a few trout.
Beauclerk did not articulate ten words; he seems happy, but it is the
bliss of torpor. She resides reluctantly in the dignified solitude of
a <i>guinguette</i> in the skirts of a petty town. From Beauclerk’s
practice one should think his precept was that conversation spoilt
society; he rarely incurs that <i>risque</i>. It is to be regretted,
as he has a most acute perception, and an uncommon degree of subtilty
in his argument. No person is clearer on the <i>obscure</i> subject
of abstract metaphysics; his definitions are ingenious and brilliant.
Finance is also a branch of political economy he is profound in, and
had he entered Parliament he would have distinguished himself. At
present he is lost; shyness, indolence, and a sort of content deprive
society of his exertions and his friends of his company.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE KING SHOT AT</div>

<p>The papers on Friday announced a singular accident which happened to
the King at the Review on Thursday in Hyde Park; a musket ball wounded
a Mr. Ongley standing near him. The question was whether it was from
design or chance—the chance of an unloaded musket. When I came home,
the first question I asked the porter in getting out of my carriage
was whether there was anything new; he replied with eager alarm that
the King had been shot at from a pistol at the play. I thought this
story an exaggeration of the former one, but to my surprise found
that the evening of the day on which he had escaped the bullet, he
was deliberately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span> aimed at from the pit. The ball lodged in the upper
boxes, and the King escaped unhurt. His behaviour was like that of a
hero of antiquity; he was in full possession of all his faculties,
and was cool enough to tell the Queen, who was not in the box when
the pistol was fired, that the report was from a squib. He remained
on during the play with the utmost sang-froid. He told a person that
he observed the fiddlers expected another shot as they covered their
heads with their cremonas. The enthusiasm was boundless; additional
verses were added by Sheridan to <i>God Save the King</i>.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> The
King was so delighted with Sheridan’s behaviour to the Princesses, for
he prevented them going into their box by saying that a pickpocket
was taken in the pit which made a riot and his presence was required,
and begged their R.H. to wait in the room. He shall feel gratitude to
the latest hour of his life, he says, to him for this sensibility.
Sheridan, Mrs. S., and Tom are all to go to Court, both to-morrow and
Thursday. Mr. Fawkener<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> dined with us on Friday; he had attended
the examination of the man at the Privy Council, and he said he was
certainly mad. He was dismissed the army for insanity a few months ago,
and he has since worked as a silver-smith; his name is Hadfield. I was
vexed at not being present. I never much liked Money Hill, but this has
disgusted me, for had I been at home I should have gone in my own box,
from where I should have seen the whole <i>representation</i>, and with
safety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span></p>

<p>Ld. Morpeth was to have come to Money Hill on Wednesday; he came to
tell me on Saturday that his carriage was at the door at one o’clock
to convey him thither, but that he was at White’s, not returned from
<i>Tuesday evening’s</i> occupation; he owned to losing two thousand
pounds. He will grow a decided gambler.</p>

<p>My old friend and admirer, Ld. Berkeley, gave Lord Chesterfield a
reproving repartee. Ld. B. has killed two or three highwaymen, and
it is known that he is distressed when the occurrence is alluded to.
Ld. C., meaning to annoy him, asked him ‘When he had last killed a
highwayman?’ ‘It was, my Lord, as well as I can recollect, just at the
time when you hung your tutor,’ alluding to the unfeeling and wicked
transaction about Dr. Dodd, who, though deserving of punishment, should
not have met with it from his pupil, who from youth and gratitude ought
to have felt more indulgence for the errors of Dodd.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>The Prince of Wales has notified his Royal pleasure of dining here. He
grew quite angry at not being invited; he even spoke to my mother about
it. He comes on Saturday, and Prince Augustus.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> The latter came
home to England without the knowledge and against the consent of their
Majesties. He arrived at the house of Lady Augusta.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MRS. FITZHERBERT</div>

<p>I went last night to the Opera. The Princess of Wales glanced many an
inquiring look towards Mrs. Fitzherbert’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span> box, in which the Prince was
as usual. This old amour is revived. The opinion of the world is so
whimsical. Every prude, dowager, and maiden visited Mrs. F. before, and
the decline of her favour scarcely reduced her visitors; but now they
all cry out shame for doing that which she did notoriously five years
ago. There is a sort of morality I can never comprehend.</p>

<p>Ld. H. took a fancy for about a week to write me some verses every
night after he went to undress; I complained of his keeping me up late,
he wrote immediately:—</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
   <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>That his labours have set you asleep, is allowed</div>
        <div>The severest reproach to a bard you can make.</div>
        <div>Have not I then great cause to be proud—</div>
        <div>Your objection to mine is they keep you awake.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>Ld. H. went to the Levée on Wednesday with Ld. Ossory to congratulate
the King upon his escape; he went also on Thursday to the Drawing Room,
and on Friday he went in a cap and gown with the Oxford Address. Mr.
Marsh came to town as a delegate; he arrived on Thursday and stayed
till this morning.</p>

<p>The Ministers have not attempted to convert this mad freak of
Hadfield’s into a Jacobinical plot; they let the affair stand plainly
as it is. When Erskine heard of the shot from a man in the pit, he
said, ‘I thought the <i>Pitt-ites</i> would do the King mischief at
last.’ Should the poor lunatic be condemned, I think the King will feel
a qualm at signing the warrant, as it is proved that the man was only
insane in consequence of a severe wound in his head received while
fighting in the King’s cause.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> As a confirmation of the opinion of
the man’s acting without any concert with other people, what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span> happened
to Mr. Tierney will acquit the soldier who fired in the Park. On
Thursday, riding from hence through the Park, he went by some soldiers
who were reviewing, and a musket ball whizzed close by his ear. He told
the story to Ford, the justice, and it is clear that the cartridges
have been made improperly, that those which used to be for exercising
with powder only, and in a particular coloured paper, are now loaded
with ball.</p>

<p>The Prince of Wales, Prince Augustus, and a very numerous party dined
here on Saturday; it went off very pleasantly. Prince Augustus is much
altered from what he was at Rome; his mind and body are thickened.</p>

<p>The Divorce Bill, with the abominable clause, has passed the H. of
Lords, the purport of which is to prevent the woman marrying the
man on whose account the divorce takes place, and in addition to
pecuniary damages to the husband, the offence is to be treated as a
<i>misdemeanour</i>, and the punishment of fine and imprisonment rests
<i>solely</i> with the judge.</p>

<p>Some persons were boasting before Mr. Fox of the excellence of the
English laws, which he said certainly were excellent, but that there
were objections at present. ‘How?’ replied the other person. ‘The law
is equally open to the peasant and the peer.’ ‘Yes,’ said Fox, ‘so is
the London tavern,’ meaning that to benefit by them one must pay dearly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MR. FOX</div>

<p>The following quotation from Carlyle’s<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> translation of Arabic
poetry has been very happily applied by General Fitzpatrick to Mr.
Fox, who is the life and soul of the Whig party, both from the opinion
entertained by them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span> of his ability, and the esteem and friendship they
bear to his person:—</p>

<p>Lord Wycombe has never passed the threshold of our doors since the day
he saw his father drive into the gates, whilst he was in the porch.
Whether he imagined the <i>rencontre</i> was the effect of design or
that he chooses to have the air of appearing to think so, I cannot
guess; but the effect, from some cause or other, has been his absence.</p>

<p>The campaign does not advance as swimmingly as was expected by the
allies. Melas, when he took the Bocchetta, expected Genoa could not
hold out long after the loss of that important pass, but Masséna is
determined to maintain himself till the last gasp, and now he is
certain of being relieved, as Bonaparte has taken the command in person
of the army of Italy.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p><i>30th May.</i>—The last date of his dispatch was ye<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span> 18th of May
at Martigny, but Berthier with the advanced division has crossed
the Mt. of St. Bernard, and has reached Aost. The French have a
<i>pied-à-terre</i> only at Genoa and Savona; Mantua, Milan, etc., are
at present in the possession of the Austrians. Melas has taken Nice,
but must quit it immediately to meet Bonaparte in Piedmont. Moreau
has advanced to within a short distance of Ulm. Knay, the Austrian
commander, is very obstinate, and strongly addicted to the old system
of carrying on war by <i>posts</i>.</p>

<p>The Emperor Paul is grown quite mad. The French have made a caricature
of him with <i>order</i> in one hand, <i>counter-order</i> in the
other, and on his head <i>dis</i>order. Sir Charles Whitworth will feel
happy when fairly off his territory, as he is capable of proceeding
to personal violence against those with whom he is incensed. The
English who inhabit Petersburg are detained as hostages for his 15,000
men in Jersey and Guernsey. Woronzow,<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> the Russian Minister, who
has resided in this country many years, is suddenly recalled, as his
dispatches have not been sufficiently abusive of this Government
to please the Imperial taste; he is quite wretched, for besides
breaking up all his old habits, he is not without apprehension of some
punishment being inflicted upon him when he returns.</p>

<p>Parr says of the Bishop of Rochester’s sermon, which was quoted so
ludicrously and well by the Duke of Clarence, that it contains ‘the
precepts of the Koran, conveyed in the language of the Stews.’<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> The
sermon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span> was preached at the Magdalen, and Mr. Grey assured me without
any joke that the doctrine and the language are both so extraordinary
that no modest woman would read it, or own to having done so.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LADY GEORGINA CAVENDISH</div>

<p>The D. of Bedford has been living here a great deal; he likes Ld. H.
very much, and has grown to vanquish his prejudice against me, enough
almost to like me. He would be ungrateful if he did not in some degree,
as he is one of the very few persons of whom I think thoroughly well:
he is honourable, just, and true. Lady John Russell<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> has been here
several times, and is remarkably gracious. This I owe to the Duke’s
frequent visits, as she is curious to ascertain what object attracts
him here, and politic enough to adapt her taste to his. The probability
is that, without her caution even, he will not marry, unless indeed he
should fix upon Ly. Georgiana Cavendish,<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> an alliance long arranged
for him by the world. Ly. G. is a most charming girl—sensible,
pleasing, full of information and totally without a particle of
affectation, and if she bestows herself upon a man equal to her in
situation, I have no doubt she will make a most delightful wife. Little
Lewis is upon the eve of making himself a great fool about her, and,
as he is not <i>séduisant</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span> in person or manner, will not gain her
heart, and a bundle of sonnets in lieu of title deeds will not operate
in his favour with the elders of ye family.</p>

<p>Ld. H. brought Sheridan and Ld. John Russell home from the H. of
Commons to a late dinner here at 8. By some accident Sheridan happened
to be out of the House just at the moment when a division might have
been made with advantage, as Sir Wm. Scott’s<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> speech made so much
impression <i>against</i> the Bill. Sr. Wm. denied the fact asserted in
the preamble to the Bill, as to ye increased frequency of divorces. He,
who is the head of the Ecclesiastical Court, spoke with weight when he
declared that the <i>crime</i> was diminishing, as there had been fewer
suits from ’90 to 1800 than from ’80 to ’90, or from 1770 to 1780. The
whole tenor of his speech was full of tenderness and right feeling
towards women.</p>

<p>I went on Monday evening to Mrs. Walker’s masquerade. I chatted
pleasantly enough with some of my old acquaintances. Mr. Grey
introduced Mrs. Grey to me,<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> as did Mr. Whitbread his wife, Grey’s
sister. Mrs. Grey is pretty and gentle, without looking so; she is
handsome Ponsonby’s sister. Mrs. W. has something pleasing in her
appearance, but ill-health and the hereditary irritability of the Grey
temper gives a certain fractious expression to her countenance: <i>au
reste</i>, she is a very worthy, excellent woman.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE KING SHOT AT</div>

<p>Sheridan entertained us with a circumstantial account<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span> of the whole
affair at the theatre on the night of the assassination. He was in
the Royal box when the pistol was fired, and saw most plainly the man
take aim. Ld. Chesterfield advised His Majesty to retire to the back
of the box, but the King said, ‘Not an inch, not an inch,’ and upon
the Queen’s entrance he waved his hand to make her keep behind, upon
the pretext of her fear of squibs. S., as soon as the poor wretch was
dragged out of the orchestra, examined him. He declares his answers
were collected and distinct, until Sr. Wm. Addington<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> questioned
him, who was extremely drunk, and suggested to the man ye plea of
insanity by his mode of examining—a plea the man craftily availed
himself of.</p>

<p>When Sheridan went to Court, the King spoke to him upon indifferent
subjects and seemed undecided whether or not he should notice the
occurrence. At length he said how much he was struck with the behaviour
of the audience, which gave S. an opportunity of saying they only
followed His Majesty’s example. After a few such flourishes the King
ended by saying he should despise himself if he had acted otherwise,
for every man ought to feel his duty, and his was to stay quiet and not
add to the alarm.</p>

<p>Mr. Abbot<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> has brought forward a Bill respecting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span> Public Debtors,
which alarmed us until it was explained, but it seems fair in
principle, tho’ ultimately we may be affected to a degree. All who have
balances in hand will hereafter pay interest upon such sums. The debt
from this family now due to Government is 53,000<i>l.</i>; the assets
are near 46, the odd thousands Ld. H. must supply. The difference of
the Bill taking effect will be that the interest must go to Governt.,
instead of making an accumulating fund, which in a few years would pay
off the whole. Mr. Moore is afraid from rumour that a clause is to be
moved by Mr. Baker to make the operation of the Bill retrospective. In
that case, to the last shilling of Ld. H.’s property must go, as the
amount would be enormous, but it seems so unjust that the alarm is, I
trust, groundless.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SIR G. WEBSTER’S DEATH</div>

<p>Early on Wednesday morning last, ye 4th of June, we were roused by a
loud rapping at the bedroom door opening into the drawing-room. My
mother cried out that she had brought great news, that Sir Godfrey
Webster was dead; that he expired the evening before in a fit. He had
been indisposed for some days, which made the event more natural. I
could not hear of his death without emotion, and was for some time
considerably agitated. But, my God! how was I overcome when Drew showed
me a hasty note written to him by Hodges to apprise me of the manner of
his death. He shot himself, he added, in consequence of heavy losses
at play. With him dies all resentment, and, great as my injuries have
been, willingly would I renounce all that may accrue to me from this
dreadful event to restore him again to existence, with the certainty of
his paying the <i>natural</i> debt of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span> nature. Unhappy man! What must
have been the agony of his mind, to rouse him to commit a deed of such
horror. Peace to his soul, and may he find that mercy I would bestow.</p>

<p>His confidential servant gave the following details: that he had
appeared frequently disordered in his mind in the course of the winter,
and that latterly his spirits were gone, and a physician attended him
for a slow fever. But the malady was deeper; it was on his mind. Twice
within the last weeks he had attempted to destroy himself by laudanum,
but each time his man interposed, once by wrenching the phial out of
his hand, and the other by compelling him to swallow an emetic. On
Saturday he despatched his relation, a Mr. Whistler, to fetch from
Sussex titledeeds of some estates, merely a device to get him out of
the way. On Tuesday he went out at nine o’clock, and purchased at Egg’s
a brace of pistols, and after various devices and stratagems to get his
servants out of the way, he but too fatally succeeded, and at half past
four shot himself in his front drawing-room in Tenterden Street. Have
mercy on him, Oh heaven!</p>

<p>Business compelled me to go to town, and my coachman drove me to the
square; the shock of being almost within sight of those mangled remains
was too much, of him, unhappy man, who now lies a melancholy proof of
feelings too acute for existence. I would not have the self-reproach of
having added one particle to the agony he endured, and am thankful that
this sad catastrophe did not arise two years ago, altho’ I should have
been as guiltless a cause as now; but the world and my own readiness
to upbraid myself would have assigned my quitting him as the cause.
Ld. Egremont,<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> with whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span> he had lately lived in habits of social
intercourse, called at his door just after the perpetration of this
dreadful act; he was excessively shocked, and went three times that
night in great agitation to Ld. Ossory’s. He declared his intention
of sending for the boys from school, and is now gone to Petworth with
Webby. Henry is with my mother. The dear girl remains at school.
Hitherto no will subsequent to that of ’86 has been found; perhaps
upon a strict examination one may be discovered. The funeral went down
this morning to Battle, very privately attended. Mr. Plummer was with
me, and told me he was a creditor to the amount of seventeen thousand
pounds.</p>

<p><i>8th June, 1800.</i>—The average produced by my estates is estimated
at seven thousand pr. anm. We shall not touch a stiver for these 18
months, and only till then incur trouble and expense. To recover the
money to fulfil the complement dictated by my grandfather’s will, I
must go to the seizure of his personal property. The sound is at first
repugnant, seize the property to which my son is heir, but, in fact, it
is only ascertaining my right, by which I shall prevent his coming upon
the Holland estates after my death.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>I have abstained from seeing company since this horrid business,
chiefly from feeling unfit for society; and, besides that, I would
not that any person should say that I exulted in an acquisition so
obtained, and I think, if I did not feel strongly myself, it would
be judicious to do nothing that might be reported to my children as
offensive. The anxiety about their guardianship is great; it does not
yet appear to whom the charge devolves. I wait quietly till the will
is found, or the one of ’86 acted upon. If none is found, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span> verbal
injunctions laid upon his family to exclude me from the happiness of
seeing my children will operate but slightly. I shall openly seize
every occasion of making them know how near an object it is to my
heart to be loved by them, and opinion will side with me, however the
Chaplins may act to annoy me. If the will of ’86 is to be in force,
then nothing will be done but by the advice of the executors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘LEGAL RECLUSES’</div>

<p>There is a curious but violent quarrel carried on between Lord Carlisle
and Lord Kenyon; they abuse each other bitterly in their different
<i>courts</i>, publicly and separately. On the night of the debate upon
the Divorce Bill, in favour of which the lawyers are very eager, Lord
Carlisle, in adverting to the various arguments, said that lawyers
were from their sedentary occupations and retired habits incapable
of judging the offences and punishments of the upper classes, and he
applied to the corps of lawyers the term of ‘legal recluses.’ Ld.
Eldon, who officiated for the Chancellor, took up the expression and
was indignant at its being applied to the enlightened body who from
their employment in human affairs were generally supposed to understand
mankind. The Bishop of Rochester was furious, and said many cutting
things to Ld. Carlisle, such as, he supposed that he would have the
offence decided upon by those only who had committed, and in a marked
manner showed he thought Ld. C. in that case entitled to judge.
The next day, Ld. Kenyon, in the Court of King’s Bench, in summing
up a charge to the jury, contrived to introduce the expression of
‘cloistered recluses’ as having been used in the H. of Lds., and again
declared his knowledge of human life to be equal to his wishes, and
thanked his God he had not the knowledge of it which was acquired by
‘titled adulterers at Newmarket, in Bond Street, and in the Stews.’ Ld.
C. has taken notice of this reference to his speech in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span> Parliament as
unparliamentary, and means to move some resolution against the printer.
He has been with Ld. Holland this morning, who has advised him to adopt
another mode, and furnished him with the words; accordingly he will
follow his advice.</p>

<p><i>9th June.</i>—Erskine came unexpectedly to dinner yesterday. He is,
as I could not help telling him, by far the most extraordinary man I
ever met with. An incomprehensible compound of wit, ability, absurdity,
folly, vanity, and sagacity. He repeated to me some lines he had
written in court upon Serjeant Lens,<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> who was examining a witness
with some pertinacity:—</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">

        <div>The Lenses that common opticians have</div>

        <div>At no time is plain, but concave and convex;</div>
        <div>Convex his own case to enlarge and expound,</div>
        <div>Concave his opponents t’obscure and confound.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p class="p-left">He can pun in rhyme, but to harmony of verse he has no pretence. He
wrote the following epigram upon a very parsimonious lady, a Mrs.
Wharton, when at Tunbridge:—</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
   <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">

  </div>

<div class="sidenote">BILL AGAINST PUBLIC DEBTORS</div>

<p>The clause in Abbot’s Bill was not designed by him to have a
retrospective operation upon those who have balances in bond due to
Governt., but it was worded with such ambiguity that it threw persons
so circumstanced into the power of the Auditors of the Exchequer. Ld.
H. begged some confidential friends to attend to get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span> it otherwise
worded, and employed Adam as counsel to get Abbot and Baker to alter
it. Tierney promised zeal and attention; Sheridan undertook it warmly.
When the day came I grew afraid of Tierney’s candour, and thought he
might yield to Abbot’s assurance of the harmlessness of the words;
for Tierney would sacrifice the interests of anybody to obtain the
occasional popularity of conciliating an opponent. I therefore enjoined
Mr. Moore to rely <i>solely</i> upon Sheridan, who tho’ <i>never</i>
punctual and not famously steady, yet would, I was persuaded, exert
himself where he thought his services material. I was right. Tierney
acquiesced in all Abbot alleged in behalf of the clause, and it was
just going to pass into the Bill, when Sheridan arrived breathless
from haste, examined the words, declared the sentence neither grammar,
logic, or sense, and employed near two hours to convince the Committee
that the ambiguous words should be expunged. They were so. The
difference lay between ‘<i>shall have been declared</i>,’ and ‘<i>shall
be</i>.’ I provoked Tierney by telling him before Whitbread, that my
instructions to Moore were to shun the honest, candid man, as he would
never help a friend at a pinch, too timid to essentially serve, too
timid to commit himself by an opinion against any man, were the grounds
not public and popular.</p>

<p>Interest commences from the enacting of this Bill, thus the interest
cannot be reserved as usual to make a fund, and thus pay off the whole
of the debt in a few years without touching us. But the principle is
just, and nothing can be said against it with any decorum: and as
it now stands it is certainly an expense, yet compared to what it
<i>might</i> have been I am satisfied.</p>

<p><i>11th June.</i>—D. of Bedford dined with us, and gave an account
of the debate last night. Ld. Carlisle was to have made his motion
against Kenyon, but a shuffling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span> sort of compromise made it go off
tamely; he agreed to withdraw it if Grenville desired it. A languid,
half shabby business. The Duke spoke. It is comical how eagerly these
seceding gentlemen embrace every opportunity of speaking; on the most
unimportant subjects unconnected with politics they attend, and say
their say. Last night the Divorce Bill was thrown out in the Commons:
not even admitted into a Committee. The mortification of its rejection
<i>thus</i> will be double to Ld. Auckland; such marked contempt.
Sheridan made an admirable speech, and did not mar the effect of it by
too much wit; his matter was excellent. Ld. H. supplied him. At his
request he wrote a little treatise which is full of sound reason and
practical good sense. I have a copy of it.</p>

<p>Ld. H.’s epigrams on Horsley<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> were lying upon my table; Ld. G.
Leveson, in rummaging over the papers upon it, found them and took
them. Ld. H. being jokingly angry, wrote this:—</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHIRAC</div>

<p>Dumont mentioned a curious anecdote of Chirac, the celebrated physician
of Louis XIV.,<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> told to him by <span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>Condorcet. At 84 years old he
fell into a violent illness, which was his last. He lay for two days in
a state of insensibility; he suddenly jumped up and sat upright in his
bed, felt the pulse of his left hand with his right, shook his head,
and in a loud voice cried, ‘On m’a appelé trop tard, le malade est
mourant,’ He immediately fell back, verified his own prediction, and
expired. He was the man roused in the night to attend a dying Cardinal,
a person of very profligate life and infamous character. To hasten the
physician, the messenger said, ‘Venez donc, il souffre comme un damné.’
‘Comment déjà?’—a bitter sarcasm in one word. He was present at a
dispute upon the Resurrection of Christ; some thought it was impossible
that he should have arisen after death. Chirac only said, ‘Si il était
mort de ma façon,’ implying without levity, his own incredulity.</p>

<p>We have had a consultation with three lawyers, Piggott, Erskine, and
Richards, upon the propriety of taking out a licence, or getting an
Act of Parliament for my name, as it is particularly enjoined by my
grandfather’s will that the person to whom the estate goes by descent
should bear his name. There is some nicety in ye question, because,
tho’ I am only just come into the profits of it, yet I was virtually
possessed of it when that unhappy man compelled me to renounce it to
him, and it may lead to an examination as to our signatures. This would
be troublesome, as out of accommodation to him I signed two bonds
without the name of Vassall. Ld. H. has only a marital dominion over
it, and cannot be subject to forfeiture. Richards and Erskine think
the title of honour supersedes all, and that no mischief has been yet
incurred. It is not yet decided. Ld. H. went yesterday to Plummer’s.
I wrote to Ld. Ossory, and begged him to accompany him—a proposal
certain of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span> pleasing, not only as it showed confidence and attention,
but that it gratified his curiosity.</p>

<p>It appears that the average of the net produce, deducting outfit,
annuities, mortgage, jointure, insurance, and, in short, every
expenditure, is within a hundred or two of six thousand pr. anm., an
ample acquisition, but as yet must not be anticipated or enjoyed. Sir
G. W. has left property, however, to answer all debts. Webby must have
1000<i>l.</i> pr. ann. certain; that accumulating for ten years and
half will be something. Henry and Harriet five thousand each.</p>

<p>Canning is immediately to be married to Miss Scott;<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> she has an
immense fortune. He has just been made a Privy Councillor and Joint
Paymaster; if ever a man was born with a silver spoon in his mouth,
surely it was him.</p>

<p>Ld. H. was telling us to-day of the whimsical effect produced by a
droll manner of compressing the substance of a man’s speech. A Mr.
Robson, who is neither witty nor clever by-the-way, gave his whole
attention to one of Windham’s speeches; he did not listen to the
other debating, and when it came to voting he rose and said that ‘The
Honourable Gentleman had declared that we were not fighting <i>for</i>
the Restoration of the Bourbons, but that we <i>should</i> fight till
they were restored, therefore he should give his vote against him.’
This done with gravity would get the laugh on his side, and provokingly
perplex his adversary.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN UNJUST WILL</div>

<p>Erskine told us a singular cause that he was called to at Uxbridge.
It was to decide upon a will supposed to have been made whilst the
testator was under the influence of some morbid, mad affection of the
mind.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span> He was the elder brother of a man with whom he had lived in the
closest habits of friendship, and to whom he was sincerely attached.
One day he came home heated and fatigued, complained of the colic, and
was advised by his brother to go to bed and drink warm rum and water.
He followed his advice, but whether the disease was naturally fever,
or that the rum created it, is not known; but the effect was raging
madness, during which he furiously inveighed against his brother for
having poisoned him in the drink. The frenzy continued, and he was
put under a mad doctor. In a few months he recovered his reason to
all intents and purposes, acted as a magistrate, fulfilled all the
functions of his station, gave law opinions, and betrayed no tokens of
insanity. But some years after when he died, it was found by the will
that he had excluded his brother, upon the old accusation of his having
administered poison to him. It came out that the man, in favour of whom
the younger brother had been disinherited, used to listen and rather
encourage his rhapsodies. Erskine substantiated the will, but made the
heir by will share alike with the lawful heir.</p>

<p>This story of rational madness reminded Ld. H. of one which Fontana
was fond of telling, because it squares with the common definition
of madness, and proves that a man may reason logically upon false
premises. A very intelligent Jesuit went mad, and his predominating
madness was that he believed himself to be a Cardinal. He was a loss
to their community, and being a very subtle logician two or three of
the cleverest of the Order undertook to argue with him, and convince by
reason that he laboured under an illusion, which he might dissipate by
force of mind. They asked him several questions as to the ceremonies
necessary to be undergone previous to the instalment of a man in the
College of Cardinals, to all of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span> which he pleaded ignorance. ‘Why
then,’ said one, ‘how can you imagine yourself to be a Cardinal?’ He
replied, ‘I tell you that I am a Cardinal, and if you do not believe me
such when I assure so, you must suppose me to be mad, and if I am mad,
how can you be so mad as to try to convince by reason one who in that
case must be labouring under an alienation of it?’ This syllogism posed
the Reverend Brothers.</p>

<p>Wm. Lamb is returned from Glasgow quite bitten with a Scotch mania.
He thinks the Scotch have outdone in moral philosophy and ethics all
who have gone before them. To use his own expression, ‘They have gone
far beyond Locke and Paley,’ ‘Yes,’ replied Ld. H., ‘so far, that they
are unintelligible,’ He was under Professor Millar,<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> a friend of
Ld. Lauderdale’s, a man who has written upon Governt., and who is the
greatest enemy of all <i>belles lettres</i> and poetry; the latter he
calls a mere jingle which proves no facts. Lamb is very clever and
pleasing, and will improve when he gets out of his love for singularity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD HENRY PETTY</div>

<p>Ld. Henry Petty unites to a sound, strong understanding a pleasant
vein of cheerful humour, with talents and advantages far beyond his
years. His simplicity and unassuming manner is the most winning of his
qualifications. His character is very like Ld. H.’s, only he has less
playfulness of imagination, and less vivacity; his turn of mind is
rather serious, but in temper, artlessness, and integrity they are more
nearly allied even than by blood. Ld. Lansdown idolises him, and with
pleasure I perceive that his tenderness is bestowed upon an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span> object
that will reward him with interest; poor old man, he wants filial
comfort.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>Bonaparte in his passage through Switzerland went to Coppet to see
Necker; some imagine that he proposed to him to accept the post of
Minister of Finance. Madame de Staël greeted the hero, and made a
political tirade for full twenty minutes; when she ceased she expected
a complimentary eulogism, all he said was, ‘Madame, a-t-elle nourri ses
enfants?’ A cutting rebuke.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>Dumont one evening read to us Rousseau’s description, in his
<i>Promenades solitaires</i>, of the Isle de St. Pierre, in which he
describes the felicity he enjoyed and his regrets at having quitted his
delicious retirement. Ld. H., who is no admirer of Rousseau in any way,
grew tired, and wrote this:—</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
   <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>Rousseau was so charmed in his island St. Pierre</div>
        <div>With walking and rowing about;</div>
        <div>I agree with him heartily when he was there</div>
        <div>’Twas a pity he ever came out.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>Ld. H. told me this morning a piece of slyness of the Jacobinical
party towards him. About two years ago a man of the name of Gurney, a
solicitor, on behalf of the manufacturers entreated Ld. H. to speak
against a Bill, which involved their interests, then brought before
Parliament. It was entitled, a Bill to prevent unlawful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span> combination
among the workmen. He spoke, and distinguished himself; his speech
was printed at Manchester and Liverpool, and distributed among the
manufacturers. It seems Burdett and Ld. Stanhope<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> grew jealous of
his popularity among <i>their</i> friends, and have now contrived to
get the petitions given to them, and have, now that resistance to it
is become a little popular, espoused the cause. Ld. Stanhope told Ld.
H. that he had made himself ‘many friends among the most valuable part
of the community.’ Ld. H. of course does not care a straw upon the
occasion one way or the other; it only makes him laugh.</p>

<p>Ld. Thanet quitted his captivity on Monday last; he is delighted at
regaining his freedom, but a little annoyed at walking the streets
where he is shown as a sight, ‘There he goes: aye, that is him.’ He
says all rooms appear immense, his eye having been so long accustomed
to the straitened little apartment he occupied. Madame Bonawitz
latterly shared his confinement: she is reckoned clever, she writes
<i>English</i> verses.</p>

<p>Our planet must have got out of its orbit and flown off further from
the sun, as the cold is very remarkable. Fires are indispensable, and
I, who have within these four years said the only place where a fire
was useful was the kitchen, am perishing. This is the 11th June, and
the servants continue fires, which is the more singular, as they in
general lay more stress upon the calendar than upon their feelings.
Bread is 17½<i>d.</i> the quartern loaf, butcher’s meat from one
shilling to 14<i>d.</i> pr. lb.; poultry, enormously dear; and every
other article of consumption in proportion. How the labouring poor

<p>I dined with the Smiths on Saturday, where I met Serjeant Law,<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
a man whose abilities are rated high in his profession, but who by a
singular piece of misfortune, has never yet had a fair opportunity
of distinguishing himself. He has a brief, clear way of expressing
himself, with a portion of causticity: he puts me in mind of Mr. Wm.
Fawkener. He dined here the next day. Our party consisted of almost all
the rising talents at the Bar, Bobus Smith, Mackintosh, Mr. Scarlett,
Sturges, Mr. Brand who, tho’ only an amateur, yet studies the law.
Fergusson, who is just liberated from the captivity of a year, called
so near the moment of dinner that it was impossible, with the most
adverse dispositions towards him, not to invite him. He accordingly
accepted the proposal. His beauty is much praised, I did not admire
him; about his mouth he has a mean expression. My <i>accueil</i> was
not flattering or warm; as a guest he had my civility, otherwise a
particle of notice would not have been bestowed. I neither like the
man nor his cause. On Sunday the Beauclerks came to stay a day or two
<i>only</i>.</p>

<p>I made, through my mother, to Mr. Frogatt a proposal to be laid before
the guardians who may be appointed for my children by Chancery, the
substance of which is an offer to take upon myself the whole expense
of the maintenance and education of Harriet, that her fortune, which
is but five thousand pounds, may be allowed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span> accumulate until she
marries or is of age. I also wrote to him myself, adding that what I
asked was solely for the girl’s benefit, and that she would be equally
under the superintendence and control of her guardians. To this offer
I this day received an answer, merely to signify to me, that Mr.
Chaplin, in pursuance of the <i>earnest</i> desire of ye late Sir G.
Webster, had applied to Chancery for the guardianship of the children:
a very improbable story, because if Sir G. Webster had recommended
his children to Chaplin, there would have existed a suspicion of his
intention of destroying himself; and, on the other hand, if it had been
his steady wish, he would at least have made a will in case of a death
as sudden and more unexpected. Sir Gilbert Affleck called upon Chaplin
yesterday, to propose to join in the application for the guardianship,
but Chaplin rejected the offer in a manner that Sir Gilbert told me it
was a force upon his feelings not to resent as it merited.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GUARDIANSHIP OF THE CHILDREN</div>

<p>Whilst Webby was at Petworth with Ld. Egremont, I wrote him a letter
under cover to Ld. E., in which, after inquiring how he was, I
conveyed my sense of Ld. E.’s kindness, adding that it was such that
it claimed the gratitude of all his family. Before this letter reached
Petworth Ld. E. had brought him to town to his grandmother’s and the
Chaplins, and I have not received a word of acknowledgment, which
seems unnecessarily harsh. This behaviour in Chaplin is the more
remarkable, as <i>he</i> has uniformly assured me that he would use
his utmost endeavours to persuade Sir G. to let me see the children.
This assurance I have under his hand and signature. Besides, he was
quite cordial when I married Ld. H., wished me joy, and wound up his
congratulatory sentence with a sort of prophecy that I should be happy,
as my disposition was of a domestic turn, and that I had never hitherto
had a fair opportunity of showing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span> real goodness of my heart. He
visited Ld. H. and me, the year after, when he came to town, and, in
short, rather affected a sort of intimacy of intercourse. I shall set
every engine to work to counteract these unjust projects.</p>

<p>A few days ago I asked Ld. Stair<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> just to mention, the first
occasion he could find naturally, to Ld. Egremont how grateful I felt
for his tenderness to my child. He did, and brought back a civil
reply. I consulted Ld. S. about asking Ld. E. to do something towards
getting me the facility of seeing my children. He told me he was a
real good-hearted man, but one who was habitually indolent and to a
degree timid as to meddling in other people’s concerns, but that tho’
he would do nothing for me, yet he was incapable of doing anything
against. However, yesterday, to my great delight, Ld. Stair told me he
had <i>de son chef</i> had a conversation with Ld. E., who not only was
not averse to me, but offered to call and explain all he knew about my
children’s concerns, and would undertake to advise Chaplin to be more
tractable. Ld. Stair advised me to write a letter of acknowledgment to
Ld. E., which I did last night. Thus I have the sanction of one of the
most respectable and worthy persons in my favour.</p>

<p>Sheridan dined with us last Friday; Mrs. S.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> was to have come, but
she was ill from having sung too much. He was in a very playful vein of
humour, and, without any marked <i>trait</i> of wit, all he said was
pleasant. Lewis was a self-invited guest, to prove to me that he and
William Lamb were cordial friends, who he knew dined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span> with us; but he
failed in that attempt, as Lamb complained that he followed him like
his shadow, and bored him insufferably. Sheridan told a story of a sale
of plants near his house. The trees were ticketed with their names. Two
country gentlemen read a ‘Dacious cypress,’ ‘This must be wrong,’ said
one, ‘there is no such word: I will make it right,’ and with his pencil
he wrote ‘<i>Au</i>dacious.’ When the little, puny deciduous cypress
appeared with such a tremendous name, the whole auction room shouted
with laughter. He said formerly the managers of the two theatres used
to send people to hiss and disturb the actors at new plays. One night
an actor complained to Garrick that the new tragedy was interrupted
and would get damned, as a Covent Garden man was in the pit laughing.
‘Never mind,’ said Garrick, ‘I shall be revenged, for I have a man fast
asleep at their new comedy.’</p>

<p>Bedford House is pulling down, and the Duke is building a new
square.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> He has some idea of erecting a statue of Ld. Russell; I
advised him to get Mr. Fox to write the prose inscription, Fitzpatrick
the verse, and Dr. Parr the Latin. If he should raise the monument he
will adopt my hint. Serjeant Lens surprised me by saying that should
this statue be erected, the populace would in all probability pull it
down. If so, public opinion has undergone a strange revolution, as he
was a martyr whom patriots worshipped,—‘That cause for which Russell
and Sidney bled.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span></p>

<p><i>19th June.</i>—I went yesterday to Hampton Court, where I slept.
Ld. H. rode over to St. Anne’s, and joined me at night. In a small
corner of the Palace erected by William now lives the Stadtholder<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
and the Princess of Orange, fugitives from those dominions their
ancestor quitted to govern these: a reflection that must be accompanied
with pangs of regret and mortification.</p>

<p>On the 19th, I went by water to Kingston Bridge, where I found my
mother, Sir Gilbert, Henry,<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> and Mr. Francis. In the evening we all
went to the Opera.</p>

<div class="sidenote">STATE OF THE WAR</div>

<p>Genoa is taken, Melas seems to have changed positions with Masséna.
Bonaparte is beyond Milan and restoring the Cisalpine Governts.</p>

<p>Francis says whilst the French armies are performing prodigies of
valour, traversing impossible mts., dragging artillery over steep
crags, disposing of empires, extending conquests, etc., we hear our
own exploits, performed by an immense fleet sailing up and down the
Channel, to be a descent upon France, and the victor’s spoil ‘<i>three
pieces of iron cannon and twenty-five cows</i>.’ Maitland<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> commands
the expedition which has been directed again against Quiberon; the most
he can do will be to singe here and there the coast of France.</p>

<p>On Thursday, ye 10th July, we quitted home to make an excursion for
two or three months upon the Continent. Our party consists of Ld.
Duncannon,<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span> Mr. Marsh, Dr. Drew, Charles, Hortense, Charles,
4 maids, and five men. We manage to stuff all into a coach and
postchaise. We set off at five o’clock in the afternoon, slept at
Epping Place; began our journey the next day at 7. At Newmarket I
saw D. of Queensberry: he wanted us to dine with him. He was violent
at the continuance of the war, and spoke roundly against Ministers.
He told Ld. H., upon the Dutch business, that if he had not made a
determination never to vote against Government he would have voted with
him upon that question. Mr. Vernon also came and sat by me whilst I
eat: he envied my stomach that could digest and relish cold meat and
porter. We stopped at Thetford. The D. of Bedford thought our coming
so uncertain, that he did not hear even of our arrival until 10, and
it was then too late to join us at supper, for we went to bed at ½
past nine. This morning we were up at 4 o’clock, off at 6, and passed
through Norwich (where Ld. D. overtook us), and got here (Yarmouth)
at about 2. Ld. Spencer wrote to order a convoy, but there is some
difficulty about getting a better than a cutter. The Admiral (Dickson)
has just been with me; he promises <i>two</i> cutters, but the lugger
in port is better.</p>

<p>We were landed upon <i>terra firma</i> within fifty hours after we had
sailed from Yarmouth, a surprisingly quiet passage. Met on our way from
the <i>jettée</i> at Cuxhaven, Mr. Arbuthnot; he now is attached to
Prince Augustus. I knew him formerly at Naples when he travelled with
Ld. Digby.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The party set off that day, and slept at Basbeck, where
there was no inn. ‘Ld. H. and self lay upon the ground in
the room we supped in; the gentlemen, Charles, and the
maids lay in a large room together.’ They took the road to
Hamburg by Cranz, crossing the Elbe at Blankenese. ‘The
wind rose and the water was rough; we were about forty
minutes in the passage.’</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">HAMBURG</div>

<p>We came through Altona to this place (Hamburg) where we are very
tolerably lodged at Kaysershoff. Mr. Berchemeyer, a great merchant,
called to offer us every civility, as did Mr. Parish, the son of the
late American Consul; he belongs to a great house of commerce. In the
evening of the 18th we drove about the ramparts, and went to the French
comedy, a neat theatre with a tolerable <i>troupe</i>.</p>

<p>During our stay at Hamburg we received much hospitality and civility.
On the Sunday after our arrival we dined with Mrs. Parish at their
country house upon the banks of ye Elbe. She is a sensible, voluble
Scotchwoman. The party consisted chiefly of merchants; Symons, his wife
and sisters, Flemings and relations of the famous coachbuilder of that
name at Bruxelles. The ladies were recently returned from Paris, but
their attire was such as Bonaparte would have corrected. We returned
early, as the gates shut always at nine, the only one which is left
open until eleven is only attainable by crossing the Alster, a sort of
lake.</p>

<p>Bourgoing,<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> the traveller and author, on his way to his mission to
Copenhagen, demanded of the Senate of Hamburg two French emigrants,
who are conductors of a journal called the <i>Censeur</i>, in which
Bonaparte is virulently and clumsily abused. Paul’s Minister, on behalf
of his master, claimed them, and the business is not settled. This is
merely a pendant to our claiming Napper Tandy, for one injustice begets
another.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span> Dumouriez is extremely out of spirits, indeed well may
he be from the absurdity and inconsistency of his conduct. All that
are busy and idle assemble at Hamburg, merchants and sharpers—Major
Semple,<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> Mr. Holcroft,<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>
    Dr. Maclean,<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> etc. On Wednesday we
dined at Monsr. Mathison’s<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>; he is a wealthy merchant married to
Henriette, one of Mde. Genlis’s <i>élèves</i>, and in consequence of
her connection with Ly. Edward<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> is become one of her most cordial
and useful friends. Ly. Ed. lives in his house.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MADAME DE GENLIS</div>

<p>Mde. Genlis was just arrived from Berlin; I felt great curiosity to see
a woman so justly celebrated for cleverness. Her countenance denotes
talent and mischief; more of the latter than real vice. She has just
published a new novel, <i>Les Mères Rivales</i>; there are some good
things in it, but it is rather tedious from its length. She gives her
political and religious creed, which are curious from the novelty of
her having any.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span> Bourbon monarchy and Papal Catholicism she now holds
to be indispensable to the benefit and salvation of mankind. Permission
has been granted for her return; her own account is that Bonaparte has
ordered her into France from regret that so great an ornament should
seek repose in a foreign country.</p>

<p>On Thursday Dumouriez and Berchemeyer dined with us. In the morning
we went to see Klopstock, the father and founder of German poetry.
He is now near 90 years of age, full of vivacity and as strong in
intellect as he probably ever was. His writings are known throughout
Germany, but are difficult to translate, as they are in the sublime,
incomprehensible style. His <i>Messiah</i> is his greatest work. He
talked to us of English literature, especially of Pope’s Homer.</p>

<p>In the evening we went with Mrs. Parish to the Syndic Dormanne’s
house in the country. It was a day of festivity, being an annual
commemoration of a charitable institution. We laughed at Marsh, who
endeavoured to make a compliment to the Syndic about his house, and
began praising it as a town house, whereas the Syndic had been pointing
out to us the <i>champêtre</i> appearance and the <i>point de vue
pittoresque</i> which it enjoyed. But Marsh persisted in his original
idea, and dwelt upon its excellence considering it was in a populous
town. The truth is the house, tho’ two miles from the city, is one in a
sort of row upon the Alster.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>They left Hamburg on July 24, to go by Hanover to Berlin,
crossing the Elbe at Tollenspicker. ‘The carriage came
over in the regular ferry boat, which is of a singular
construction considering that the waves are sometimes
high; the ends are both open. Marsh and Duncannon bought a
horse between them, which keeps up with German travelling,
a proof of its rapidity!’ They slept the first night at
Lüneburg. The road to Zell lay through a stretch of forest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
land, but sparsely inhabited, ‘not more than three villages
sprinkled over an extent of thirty miles.’ Lady Holland
says, ‘On the whole it is the worst country I ever saw, and
naturally so incapable of improvement that it would baffle
the agricultural skill of our English improvers.’</p>
</div>

<p>From Zell to Hanover two posts: we were eight hours. Saw nothing but
forests of diminutive firs, deep sands, and barren wastes. In fifty
years there may perhaps be a tolerable road; at present all that
appears is that probability. The <i>chaussée</i> is marked out, trees
were planted, and even in some places stones are collected in heaps,
but only here and there for about a hundred yards are any laid on the
road; and where there is that small portion of <i>pavé</i>, it seems
merely to be a pretext for a heavy toll. Well may these Hanoverian
surveyors boast, as did one of the French patriots, that they labour
for posterity!</p>

<p>Arrived at Hanover ye 27th July, 1800.</p>

<p><i>28th.</i>—The King’s stables, or rather stud, are very fine. It
is from hence he is supplied with the white and cream-coloured horses
which draw his state coach; they are beautiful animals, but have a
diseased, unhealthy look, especially about the eyes, which have a
reddish hue. The breed of horses and men are alike, and I could trace
a likeness to my liege Lord and Sovereign among his coach horses. They
breed good-sized mules from Italian asses. I was surprised at finding
them so good in this cold climate, for tho’ as hot as Italy now, the
cold in winter is insufferable. The riding house is large and grand;
one or two riding masters were busy <i>dresser</i> these <i>manège</i>
horses. It is a graceful action, a man on a well-dressed horse, and
it is much to the loss of our young men that the slouching fashion of
riding gets the better of the <i>manège</i> method. The boys hoot at
Duncannon and Marsh, and abuse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span> them for their ignorance of riding,
calling out jeeringly ‘Englan<i>der</i>.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">HANOVER</div>

<p>Saw a beautiful palace built by the D. of York, sold by him to one
Eckhart, an army commissary, and repurchased by the King; and now
occupied by Prince Adolphus.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> It is exactly like a Paris hotel; the
whole was executed under the direction of a French architect, and the
furniture and decorations brought from Paris and Lyons. The Electoral
Palace is old, irregular, and vast. One of the inner courts was
destroyed by fire, and rebuilt by George II. In his private apartment
they showed us the altar he commonly used, which had been rescued from
the flames; it was very much scorched. His common walking cane the
<i>concierge</i> kissed with veneration, adding, ‘<i>He</i> loved us,
<i>he</i> lived among us.’ The Hanoverians are short-sighted enough
to regret not having their Sovereign among them; they long for the
splendour of a Court, without taking into account that his residence
would entail taxes, burthens of various sorts, and perhaps wars.</p>

<p>A dark passage between the ball-room and the Electress’s private
apartments is shown as the spot where Königsmark was murdered. He had
slipped out from the festive scene to indulge in the softer delights
of love in the arms of the Electress; on his return he was rushed upon
by the guards with their halberds, and dispatched. Various stories
were invented, some that he was put into an oven and suffocated,
another that he was thrust into a reservoir and drowned, another that
the Elector (George I.) kept him to enjoy ye sight of his torture,
etc. True it was that he disappeared, and that the Electress was
banished her husband’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span> presence and exiled to a castle at <i>All</i>
or Aller.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> She was never permitted to go to England, or assume
the title of Queen. Some time afterwards B. Hoadly to satisfy the
royal suspicions wrote the play of <i>The Suspicious Husband</i>,
which proves that a gentleman may be in a lady’s bedroom at night most
innocently. Königsmark was but a <i>mauvais sujet</i>; he had run off
from England for murder. He shot Mr. Thynne in Hyde Park to prevent his
marrying an heiress he had designs upon.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>In the evening we went to drink tea with P. Adolphus at Montbrilliant.
He is remarkably handsome and pleasing in his manner, and since the
decline of the Prince’s beauty, is certainly the best looking of the
Royal Family. He complains of being exiled. He left England when he
was 12 years old, and since that time has only been there for four
months. I renewed my acquaintance with Count Münster and Tatter, two
Hanoverians whom I had formerly known at Rome when they were attached
to Prince Augustus.</p>

<p>When we arrived at Brunswick we found the inns filled with Jews and
infidels on account of the Fair, which is a great epoch in German
festivity. We, however, obtained a tolerable lodging. Mr. Kinnaird is
living in a <i>Swiss</i> pension, imbibing Genevan principles; these
upon a Scotch <i>fond</i> will produce a useful man to <i>himself</i>
and family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">BRUNSWICK</div>

<p>A most gracious invitation from the Court immediately on our arrival
being known; we dined there the next day. The Duke is a worthy nephew
of the great Frederick’s; but for the unfortunate invasion of France,
he would have been in addition to the best general of his time the most
successful.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> His countenance marks a man of great talent. He is
reckoned reserved, but his good breeding prevents it from falling into
coldness. The Dss. is a most excellent, prating, good-hearted woman,
very like her brother the King, full as talkative and inquisitive,
but much less discreet. She rattled away upon all subjects. She put
many distressing questions to me about the P. and Pss., especially as
to the renewal of the <i>amour</i> with Mrs. Fitzherbert, about which
I expressed the most profound ignorance. She could not conceal her
dislike of the Queen, whom she called haughty and proud of her station,
as she was but the daughter of an inferior Prince of Mecklenburg, an
appanage of the family.</p>

<p>After dinner the Dss. desired I would join her to pass the eve. at
Mde. Deodati’s, a dull card assembly. The weather was very hot. Poor
Drew fell ill, and kept his bed; a fever and spasms. On Thursday we
dined again at Court. In the evening went to the French comedy: a
very pretty theatre; afterwards to Mr. Des Arte, merely to please Mr.
Kinnaird, who is living with him. Mr. Ridley, a good-humoured young
man, K.’s fellow-traveller. On Friday received another invitation to
dine at Court; I wrote a letter of acknowledgment and apology to the
good Duchess. Drew was better, and we set off to Helmstadt.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span> On the
right-hand side of the road a building with four painted towers, which
belies its warlike appearance, as it is nominally the seat of peace
and bliss—a convent; tho’ in fact hatred and discord sojourn chiefly
within such walls, and Ariosto was scarcely satiric when he makes the
angel seek discord in a monastery. Upon second thoughts I believe he
sought indolence, not discord. He might, however, have named both; one
is suspended only by the other.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The first night was spent at Helmstadt, the second at
Magdeburg. ‘Magdeburg is the frontier town on Prussian
territory. It was sacked by the barbarous Tilly at the
beginning of the bloody wars under Gustavus Adolphus, and
it has since afforded a prison to La Fayette, who lived a
year in the citadel, before he was transferred to a more
rigorous jailor, the Emperor.’</p>

<p>Zefur, their next halt. ‘We went to the worst inn, where
we were abominably cheated and abominably lodged.’ They
reached Potsdam at one o’clock the next night.</p>
</div>

<p>We went to the Palaces. I saw them about four years ago, but as they
are very fine I did not dislike another visit to them. The Great
Palace contains rooms as superb as any in Versailles, and may vie with
those at Rome and Genoa. Sans Souci, the retreat of Frederick, is a
delightful habitation. His apartment is entire: his private library
(consisting solely of French books) is untouched. In his bedroom the
only picture is a portrait of Gustavus Adolphus; in an adjoining room
a bronze bust of Charles XII. of Sweden. I paid my homage to the
apartment of Voltaire. He occupied it many years, until he capriciously
quarrelled with his Royal patron.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SANS SOUCI</div>

<p>Close by the windows of Frederick’s private apartments are the
monuments of his dogs—large flat stones with their names simply
inscribed upon them. Near is a space he allotted to himself, as he
desired to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span> interred amidst these barking favourites; but his
successor wisely disobeyed the injunction, and gave the atheistical
Monarch Christian burial. Marsh was furious. I thought the profanation
of giving the form of tombstone was the provocation, or the marked
contempt of sacred rites in desiring to be buried in the centre of his
dogs, but I suspect his anger proceeded from some other cause, his
marked preference for those animals above his fellow creatures.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, 6th August.</i>—Road to Berlin excellent; arrived to
dinner at ½ past one. When I was there four years ago I only stayed a
couple of days, but barely sufficient to see the public buildings. Ld.
Carysfort,<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> the English Minister, and family were just arrived.
It is a new career for him, and one he enters into to repair the
derangement of a small fortune and owes to the interest of his wife,
who is Ld. Grenville’s sister. Mr. Garlike, poor Spencer’s friend, had
been Chargé d’Affaires. He is a mild, gentlemanlike man; he remains on
as Secretary to the Legation. Ld. H. had formerly been a good deal in
the Berlin society, particularly at Prince Ferdinand’s,<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> to whom he
made himself known, and we went there one evening to supper. The Pss.
is very talkative, and seems cross and clever.</p>

<p>I sent my card to Ly. C. as wife to the protector of the English, a
respect usual and due to the office; she did not return hers. It seemed
an unnecessary rudeness, but I presume she did as I did, viz., what we
each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span> thought right to be done. Ld. C. invited the gentlemen to dinner;
Ld. H. refused civilly. I was confined to my bed and to the house for a
few days with a sharp fever and sore throat, ill enough to take James’s
powders and bark. I went to the German play, not a word of which could
I comprehend.</p>

<p>By mere accident we were introduced to their Prussian Majesties<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> in
the gardens of Charlottenburg. Ld. H. and Duncannon had missed their
presentation to the King by coming too late. He was going into Silesia,
and another day had not been fixed. I did not dream of being presented
to the Queen. However, during our walk we saw her glide like a nymph,
with a child in each hand, along the Terrace; soon after Mde. de Voss,
her <i>Gde. Maîtresse</i>, came and spoke to me and asked our names,
which as soon as she heard she offered to introduce us to the Queen. We
accordingly had the pleasure of seeing a most lovely woman; her figure
is the finest I ever saw, her manner very affable and easy. She told
me she was sorry we were going away from Berlin, but invited us back
in three weeks to the reviews. The King came up to us; he is a fine,
stout, soldier-like looking man. They are extremely attached to each
other; it was unlike Royal marriages, but was a union of love. She is a
Pss. of Mecklenburg. The children played and kissed Charles, who seemed
to abate his usual shyness in their favour.</p>

<p>At the Pss. Ferdinand’s at Bellevue I made acquaintance with Mde.
du Néal, whom I liked extremely. We had some thoughts of going to
Rheinsberg, the residence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span> of Prince Henry;<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> she fortified us in
the idea, and offered letters to her two nieces, who compose part of
his Court. Mr. Bruce, Ld. Elgin’s brother, lodged in our hotel; he is
going back to India by way of Constantinople, where he means to visit
his brother; he dined with us. Ld. H. invited him out of good nature,
from hearing he was solitary and unacquainted with the society of
Berlin. Baron Schack, a <i>gens d’armes</i> [<i>sic</i>], to whom we
had been civil in London, was at Berlin; he was too much occupied with
love, gambling, and military duties to be of much service to us.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RHEINSBERG</div>

<p>Determined to go to Rheinsberg. Set off at 12 o’clock at night on
Wednesday, 17th August. Left Charles and Drew: they were to go to
Potsdam. We were to join them there. Ld. Duncannon and myself went in
the open carriage; Ld. H., Marsh, and Hortense in the chaise; ye coach
and three servants left with Drew and Charles.</p>

<p>As soon as we reached Rheinsberg on Thursday eve. we went to the
inn, and sent out letters to the ladies and Count Brühl, one of the
Chamberlains. They were all at the <i>spectacle</i>, but the gentlemen
came out and invited us from the Prince to lodge in his <i>château</i>
and to join him at the play. The latter was rather inconvenient as we
had no clothes with us (the other carriage being behind), besides that
we had travelled all night, and were dinnerless. Those difficulties
were soon settled, and we got in time to see the <i>Petite Pièce</i>.</p>

<p>The Prince is one of the most remarkable men in Germany; he
distinguished himself in his brother’s wars as a consummate general,
and may boast of having done that which is almost unparalleled, of
having put a French army to flight; at Rosbach they fled before him. He
is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span> 75 years old, and possesses a strength and vivacity of intellect
equal to what he formerly enjoyed. He is a Frenchman in his heart, he
abhors everything German; cannot speak it. He has a delightful French
comedy; his <i>troupe</i> of comedians is really good, the theatre
remarkably pretty. I never passed five days more delightfully than
under his hospitable roof.</p>

<p>The ladies we found clever, handsome, accomplished, and witty, and
endowed with some qualities so rare and captivating that they inspired
a sincere attachment. Mde. de la Rocheaimon is so perfectly pleasing,
good-hearted, sensible, and amiable, that I never yet saw the person
before whom I wished to have been my sister. I should like to pass many
of my future days in her society. Her cousin, Mde. Peneval, is witty
and highly accomplished; she is more <i>spirituelle</i> than the other,
and the other is merrier. She is the widow of a French officer, who was
attached to the service of P. Henry; upon his death she was penniless
with three children. The Prince continues her husband’s pension,
lodging, etc.; the more kind, as she is, as she says, ‘La première
femme qui ait trouvé grâce auprès de lui.’ His weakness does not lie in
his love for the female sex.</p>

<p>We supped in a Chinese temple in the garden. It was illuminated,
and we had some excellent French horns playing in the wood; it was
delicious. The next morning we breakfasted by the lake; I bathed in it.
The Prince, and indeed the whole party, did every earthly thing they
could imagine would please us; I never experienced such warm-hearted,
zealous, unaffected desire of obliging as they manifested towards us.
He gave us extra plays, and, in short, did the utmost of his power to
convince us how much he was pleased at our visit. Rheinsberg is the
place where Frederick II. wrote his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span> <i>Anti-Machiavel</i>, and where
he lived during the latter end of his father’s life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN UNNECESSARY ALARM</div>

<p>Drew grew uncomfortable at staying alone at Potsdam, and employed a
certain but alarming method of abridging our pleasure; he said Charles
was ill. We set off on Tuesday morning, perfectly persuaded we should
find the dear boy, if not quite well, yet at the worst only slightly
ill, but we would not risk the possibility of his being really ill, so
we went. We travelled all night and reached Potsdam at seven o’clock on
Wednesday. Found Charles feverish, but not worse than he has been fifty
times since his birth.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>They left Potsdam two days later, passing through a dreary
country to Wittenberg and on to Torgau. From thence to
Leipsic and Dresden.</p>
</div>

<p>We quitted Dresden on Thursday, the 18th of September; dined early
before we set off and got in two hours and a half to Meissen. During
the night Elliot<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> sent us an <i>estafette</i> with our English
letters, among them one from Mr. Moore to tell us the application for
leave for us to pass through France was referred from the Duke of
Portland’s office to Ld. Grenville’s; one from Mr. Fawkener saying that
there were obstacles, but he hoped they might be removed.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>They left next day for Weimar.</p>
</div>

<p>We arrived at Weimar between one and two. We passed the Dowager
Duchess’s palace, which stands to the left of the road. I had a
letter to D. Dss.,<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> but my low spirits about my eyes determined
us to go on as fast as we could to Cassel, there to wait the decision
whether to go by Cuxhaven home or by Calais. Dined; drove to Moutier’s
establishment at Bellevue. Since the Jacobinism has prevailed so
universally in the German Universities, young men go to this sort of
private Academy. We drove about and walked in the English garden,
which was made under the inspection of the famous Goethe, author of
<i>Werther</i>, and Prime Minister of this Duchy. Mr. Lawrence<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>
called in the evening; he is a whimsical young man, who has written
several strange things, but not wholly without talent. Ld. H. sent
a letter to Wieland to solicit his acquaintance, but he was in the
country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OBLIGING OFFICIALS</div>

<p>On arrival at Cassel Holland and Marsh called upon the French Minister,
<i>le citoyen Rivale</i>, who was remarkably civil, and gave the
passport from Bournonville. The passport is made out in the most marked
and obliging manner, everything troublesome omitted, no time limited,
no descriptions of our persons, and the route left blank for us to fill
up to Paris if we choose. The Secretary of Legation, Senurier, was
very good-natured to me. I had heard stories of robberies committed
by deserters beyond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span> the French frontier but within their line of
demarcation, which rather alarmed me, and made me wish to have an
escort if possible. He accordingly gave a letter to any commander we
might find before Coblentz. Mr. Lorentz, the banker, very useful and
civil: he dined with us, managed about money, as it is illegal to draw
upon England from French territory.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>They started again on the 26th, and reached Weilburg on
the 28th. ‘I saw French proclamations posted up in the
villages, signed <i>Augereau</i>.’ They slept that night at
Montabaur.</p>
</div>

<p>We got off early on ye 29th. Woods to Coblentz. Met a French general,
escorted by cavalry. Wood chiefly copse, country much inferior in
beauty to that we quitted. Ehrenbreitstein repairing; the village
under the fortress quite ruined, churches and convents unroofed and
demolished, but the peasants are active in repairing their habitations.
Ld. H. showed his passport and had a pass given for persons and
horses to cross the Rhine. Crossed in the <i>pont-volant</i>: all of
us and our baggage stopped at the Custom House. I went to the inn
with Charles. Ld. H. went to the banker; some difficulty in arranging
about money for Bruxelles. Mr. Lorentz rather in fault. Ld. H. showed
passport in the evening to the <i>Préfet</i>, Boucqueau, who was
remarkably well-bred and civil. Banker’s name Botsgeissen; married to
a Leeds woman. The Electoral Palace in the town is converted into a
hospital. The inhabitants pay great contributions; it falls hardest
on landholders. The German play driven out by a French <i>troupe</i>,
who have established a French <i>spectacle</i>. The establishment of
juries seemingly popular. Heard of a famous robber towards Trêves,
who maintained banditti, bribed peasants, and gave passports, and who
is particularly inveterate against the Jews. Country cultivated, and
provisions, at least bread, very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span> cheap. Very different accounts of the
French, but all agreeing in the improvement since Bonaparte, and in
wishes for peace. The people are allowed great freedom of speech; they
paid more for having given an asylum to the emigrants, which seemed
very unjust upon them. All religion tolerated and none interfered with;
monks as usual, but I saw none. The inn excellent, quite new; not the
same as the one I used to go to....</p>

<p>I laughed heartily at the sight of a monk with a French cockade in his
hat. To the left, about a mile from Bonn, there is a fine castle upon
an eminence. The modern <i>châteaux</i> of the nobility are deserted,
and many totally destroyed from being unroofed and <i>gutted</i>. The
Elector’s country palace was magnificent; it is now converted into a
hospital. Bonn is a clean, well-built town, the Palace immense, now
inhabited in parts by officers and magistrates, but chiefly falling
to decay. The Tree of Liberty decorated with the tricolour flag. I
was surprised instead of finding the old inn, which was very good, to
find a new one just built upon a most magnificent scale. The road from
Coblentz to Bonn is good; from Bonn to Cologne sandy and deep, country
flat, but rich and well cultivated.</p>

<p>A mile or two before Cologne a bend of the river extremely beautiful.
Wrote our names at the gates; one of the guard was a drunken Irishman,
who with the rest of the vagrant scum of Europe composed the <i>Polish
legion</i>. Cologne is a large, gloomy town, overrun with monks and
beggars. The inn was excellent; it had just been repaired and newly
furnished. We were surprised that, considering the interruption
there must have been to travelling, accommodations and post horses
should have been so good and abundant. We went to the play, which
was bad enough, but like all foreign theatres well attended. The
<i>gendarmes</i> and hussars very handsome;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span> we agreed that the French
officers were better looking than formerly. The reason, I suppose, is
that under the <i>ancien régime</i> the officers were chiefly noble;
now a man is taken out of the ranks and dubbed General....</p>

<div class="sidenote">STEPHEN’S DEATH</div>

<p><i>Sunday, Jan. 25, 1801, Staines Inn.</i>—The complaint in my eyes
and alarm about my poor child prevented me from enjoying myself during
the last two months of my foreign excursion. After passing many
watchful nights, and latterly for 8 together, by the side of my dear
boy, he was snatched from me, alas, for ever.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> He died on the
day devoted to mirth, his dear father’s birthday. On ye 22nd early,
we quitted H. H., and took up our residence at Ld. B.’s in Cavendish
Square during their absence at Chatsworth. I was broken-hearted and
dispirited for many weeks.</p>

<p>Soon after, Charles caught the measles, and luckily for my peace of
mind had them most favourably. His little endearing qualities, and
Ld. H.’s affection, the kindness of friends, and the hope of having
more children, have to a degree soothed my feelings, but oh! my God,
what anguish can equal the pang a mother feels who sees her infant
struggling against death. What I have endured worlds should not bribe
me to undergo again. Beauclerk, as soon as he heard of our distress,
came to town to see us, and with real heartfelt interest entered into
our sorrows. Mrs. Smith showed herself affectionate and tender: and
the D. of Bedford continued in town, and stayed as much with us as
possible; indeed, day after day he devoted to being in our company. We
had taken a mere nutshell, a <i>pied-à-terre</i>, in Stratton Street;
my spirits have been so low that the small and varying society that I
got of evenings from those that drop in amuses and cheers me. I write
at this moment at Staines,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span> where I am with Charles and Ld. H., partly
that the first may be shown to his uncle, and partly that Ld. H. may
see <i>his</i> uncle, and endeavour, with Grey, to prevail upon him to
resume his parliamentary functions.</p>

<p><i>Stratton Street, 30th Jan., 1801.</i>—A rumpus in the Cabinet,
supposed about the Catholics. The opening of the Imperial
Parliament<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> has been delayed already three times, and the day for
which it is fixed at present is not the one it will, according to all
expectation, meet upon. Various reasons are assigned for the delay,
and the wise-heads are full of strange and curious speculations upon
the occasion. Some imagine Ministers are negotiating, not to obtain
peace, but to get a reply from Bonaparte declaring his intention of
maintaining the demand of the Northern Confederacy with respect to
neutral bottoms, by which they will succeed in making the Northern war
popular with the country. Others, that great concessions have been made
to Russia to withdraw her from the confederacy, even to the sacrifice
of Hanover. Others, that the King is more in want of Dr. Willis<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>
than of his Lords Temporal and Spiritual assembled in High Parliament.</p>

<p>It is a curious circumstance to reflect upon, that in the course of
a very few years France, whom we expected to crush and entered into
a league against with half the powers of Europe, should now have so
completely turned the tables upon us as to head triumphantly the most
formidable combination that was ever undertaken. If the King of Prussia
marches to Hamburg (which unquestionably is his object), and the French
compel the Portuguese to renounce our alliance, we shall not have a
friendly port from the North Pole to Africa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">SECESSION ABANDONED</div>

<p>Opposition mean to attend actively this session. Grey has renounced
the errors of secession, and tho’ Fox still hangs back, I think a few
strong divisions will be irresistible and make him return to the career
in which he has outstripped every competitor. Ld. Darnley has attached
himself with warmth to Opposition, and intends to bring on a motion
upon the State of the Nation. To-day has brought another convert, Ld.
Fitzwilliam,<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> who has expressed a wish of moving the amendment, one
very hostile to Ministers and, strange to say, full of pacific wishes.
His respectability, high name, and integrity of character carries
great weight, and will add much to the slender forces of a disjointed,
disbanded Opposition. The D. of Bedford pledges himself to nothing,
but his inclination leads him to attend and would conquer, but for Ld.
Lauderdale’s jokes, who is always telling him he delights in making a
long prose to the House of Lords, for which he never indulges himself
on any question but on those that would make Cicero or Fox prose,
<i>scarcity</i>, poor laws, enclosures, etc., etc.</p>

<p>Ld. Wycombe, who obtained passports to go through France in his way to
Florence to get witnesses, was at Paris during the explosion of the
<i>infernal car</i>, and within 220 paces of it at the moment of its
blowing up.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p><i>11th Feb., 1801. Stratton Street.</i>—During the Rebellion in
Ireland made by the United Irishmen, it used to be the phrase, when
a disturbance broke out in a town, to say, ‘They have got the Union
among them.’ That cant saying might now be applied to a higher sphere,
as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span> since the Union of the Kingdoms the Cabinet has been divided, and
at this juncture broken up. Reports and opinions are so different and
various that I can collect nothing that gives me a very distinct idea.
At present all that can be depended upon is that Pitt, Grenville,
Dundas, Windham, Lds. Camden and Spencer, have resigned their
places, and are virtually out of office, altho’ the former remains
in until he has made the loan and opened the Budget. The occasion of
this extraordinary breaking up of the Administration is the King’s
peremptory refusal of assenting to the Emancipation of the Catholics,
a measure Ministers consider themselves as pledged to, and a promise
of which was one of ye instruments of conciliation to all parties to
obtain the Union.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PITT’S RESIGNATION</div>

<p>It now appears that the King was all along against the Union,
foreseeing that this question would be the price of it. It appears
incredible that Ministers should esteem themselves so irrevocably
bound to the Catholics, when the opinion of the King has uniformly
been against complying with that measure, which they must have known
at the time they held out the promise to the Irish. The King believes,
and the belief so inculcated is sedulously maintained in his mind
by the Bishops (especially by ye Archbishop of Canterbury and Dr.
Stuart,<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> the Primate of Ireland), that any such relaxation towards
the Catholics is incompatible with his Coronation oath. It was owing
to these differences that the meeting of Parlt. was delayed on account
of the tenor of the Speech. Pitt wanted it to breathe toleration and
indulgence in the true spirit of amity; the King absolutely rejected
all such promises. During the week in which the Speech was adjusting,
there were many rumours of a change of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span> Administration; indeed, one
day they were so current that I believed enough to be tempted to
send to Lansdown House to ascertain whether its noble owner had been
sent for from Bath. Several tradesmen distributed their commodities
gratis, so great was the joy; but on the Saturday previous to the
meeting of Parlt. all was supposed to be amicably settled owing to the
interposition of the Speaker, who was closeted with the King several
hours during the Queen’s concert. However this honourable friend was
occupied in a different negotiation than that designed for him by
his munificent patron and employer—in one no less surprising and
despicable than of tripping up his heels and offering his services
to replace him. This huge and monstrous act of ingratitude was known
publicly last Saturday, and Pitt on Monday, in his place, announced
his resignation, and Ld. Grenville last night in the House of Lords
spoke to the same effect. Nothing is yet known certainly as to the new
Ministry; many of the places cannot be filled, and the opinion is they
cannot hold together a month. Ld. Carlisle refused; at least he was
sounded. Ld. Macartney refused. Jekyll said an Administration, formed
out of the dregs of the old one and leaving Pitt out, was like getting
up <i>The Beggar’s Opera</i> without the character of Macheath.</p>

<p><i>14th Feb., 1801.</i>—Yesterday was a political fast ordered by
Parliament during the continuance of the war. Jekyll wrote <i>ex
tempore</i>:—</p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
   <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div>Why on this day the lot d’ye cast</div>
        <div>To mortify the <i>British</i> nation,</div>
        <div>When every day’s a general fast</div>
        <div>And every hour’s humiliation?</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p class="p-left">(<i>British</i> added by Lewis to make the metre.)</p>

<p>Some person asked Jekyll why he did not put the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span> Administration into
verse, upon which he said it was already <i>inverse</i>.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 26, 1801.</i>—The first laugh over, people begin to think this
Administration may last, and if they commence a negotiation they will
even become popular. Pitt, however, is regretted, and there are those
who think the whole a juggle, that he is, in fact, Minister behind the
curtain; but these are refinements. He certainly solicits persons to
take office, and his own friends to hold those they have; but this is
but a shallow artifice to prevent the odious cry of his deserting the
King. The new Ministers like to let it appear that Pitt is cordial to
them, and account for the resignations by saying those who resign are
chiefly of Canning’s faction, and that Pitt has reprimanded Canning for
his intemperate language.</p>

<p>Lady Buckingham<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> (the Marchioness), the first drawing room after
these changes, went to give thanks for her peerage (Baroness Nugent,
with remainder to her second son); she is a bigoted Catholic, and gave
great scandal during her husband’s government in Ireland by attending
the R. C. Chapel openly. When she stood in the circle to be spoken to,
the King came up to her and began a conversation, in the midst of which
she turned upon her heel and said aloud to the person next to her, ‘I
think I have treated him coldly enough.’ His Majesty heard her, and
in an irritated tone said, ‘I don’t mind women’s politics.’ Those who
are for Catholic Emancipation affect to believe that the discontents
upon its rejection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span> will break out, and an invasion from France will be
successful.</p>

<p>This opinion produced a <i>bon mot</i> from a man who never made one
before. A person asked Lord Brome<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> who was to succeed his father
(Ld. Cornwallis) in Ireland. ‘Most probably <i>Bonaparte</i>,’ replied
the youth.</p>

<p>Lady Clare began abusing Ld. Cornwallis furiously before the Duchess of
Gordon, who coolly answered that she ‘had never heard him abused but
for two things, one was the not putting the town of Seringapatam to
the sword, the other, that in Ireland he never whipped nor tortured.’
The retort was keen, as Lord Clare<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> made a speech in favour of the
enormities committed by the Orangemen, which is called and known by the
name of ‘The torture speech.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE KING’S ILLNESS</div>

<p><i>8th March, 1801.</i>—The King is recovering as fast as he can,
say the courtiers; Pitt’s people cautiously say he may amend, but it
must be slowly; Opposition declare he is as mad as the winds. Upon the
first signal of madness the Prince notified to Ld. Fitzwilliam that
circumstances were similar to those in ’88–’89 and that it was his
intention to consult those who had been his friends at that period, and
he wished Ld. F. to discuss it over with those with whom he had acted
at that period. Ld. F., rather precipitately, sent off an express to
St. Anne’s to fetch up Fox, who came early the next morning. Ld. Moira
saw Grey and the D. of Bedford (separately) and proposed to each the
formation of an Administration in case of a Regency, without either
Fox or Pitt. This they declined, and unequivocally declared they would
never take office unless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span> Fox was the efficient man in the Cabinet. Ld.
Moira had a private interview afterwards with Fox, in which nothing
very material passed. The Chancellor begged to see Fox that they might
refer back to their joint proceedings in ’88: Fox was astonished at the
C.’s want of memory. He did not think his forgetfulness was wilful.
In the course of their meeting, Loughborough gave him to understand
that he was authorised to express Pitt’s wishes for an accommodation
in private, and his disposition to adjust their differences of opinion
upon the question of right, but Fox declined the interview on hearing
the arguments, adding that the House of Commons was the proper place
for political opponents to debate in.</p>

<p>Pitt is still Minister. The King’s illness occurred on Saturday, and
the patent to admit Addington was to have been signed on Thursday:
thus Addington has given up an immense place of £7000 pr. ann., and
undergone the expense of his election, for the bare honour of having
been thought worthy of His Majesty’s confidence.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> Windham says he
is one of the gentlemen who are <i>shut in</i>. Those only who are
fairly out are Lord Spencer and Ld. Grenville.</p>

<p>The first act of Ld. St. Vincent’s Administration<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> was a pretty
hard rap at Ld. Spencer’s; he gave the command of the Channel fleet to
Ad. Cornwallis,<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> a man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span> whom Ld. S. had brought to a Court martial
and in a manner laid aside and disgraced.</p>

<p>Ly. Spencer<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> cannot reconcile herself to the insignificance
of being out of power; she is carrying on an intrigue with Mrs.
Fitzherbert thro’ Jack Payne to reinstate Mr. Pitt, by making him
acceptable to the Prince. Ly. S. is the greatest prude alive, and
yet because it is her interest she passes many hours daily with Mrs.
F.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> The latter is rancorous against Fox; she has never pardoned
his compliance with the Prince’s orders in the last Regency, when he
declared that no marriage had taken place between them.</p>

<p><i>9th March.</i>—A person said to the Duchess of Gordon that Pitt,
now he was out of office, would have leisure to amuse himself and
indulge in his favourite recreations. Among the latter <i>Pope Joan</i>
was named. ‘Aye,’ said the Dss., ‘I wish he would think more of
<i>Joan</i> and less of the Pope’—more of the ladies and less of the
Catholics.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MR. GEORGE PONSONBY</div>

<p>George Ponsonby, distinguished in Ireland as a pleader and orator,
has carried the election for the County of Wicklow. During the poll a
man upon the hustings assigned for reason of his voting against him
that <i>common report</i> said he had been connected with the United
Irishmen. ‘<i>Common report</i> is known to be a liar,’ said Ponsonby,
‘and so, I think, are its trumpeters.’ More is expected from him in
the Imperial Parlt., than from all the Irish put together; his talents
are supposed to be well adapted to the English style of debate, and
his language good without being too florid, the common defect of
Irish eloquence. He is cautious, and will not hastily risk impairing
the reputation he has already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span> acquired. Mr. Fox has not the highest
opinion of his political honesty, but Grey, who loves with fervour
every person connected with him, is jealous at the suspicion.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>
We must wait to see how opportunity may tempt and time mature his
propensities.</p>

<p>Horne Tooke has at length got into Parlt. for the rotten borough of Old
Sarum, through the patronage of Lord Camelford. Ld. Temple has given
notice of a motion to investigate into his eligibility; the question is
whether he can sit in Parlt. after having taken priest’s orders. He has
already spoken frequently, but his wit suits the mob at the hustings
better than the genteel mob of Parlt. He is too fond of talking of
himself, and his jokes are trite. He made formerly a very satirical
good joke in a toast, and it was so well disguised that what is very
Jacobinical appears extremely loyal—‘<i>The brave followers of the
Duke of York</i>,’ meaning the <i>French</i>, who pursued him when his
army was put to flight in Holland. It will be a good expulsion for ye
Opposition, as he is very mischievous, and would overset any little
popularity they might acquire if they could conduct themselves with
tolerable prudence.</p>

<p><i>11th March.</i>—Lord Morpeth is to be married in a few days to
Lady Georgina Cavendish, a suitable match in every respect. Without
possessing great beauty she has many charms, and is so well disposed
that <i>il a beau jeu</i> before him, if he will renounce <i>le
gros jeu</i>, but it unfortunately happens that love only suspends
that passion when it has taken deep root. However, he has so good
an understanding and such right feelings, that what a man can do to
conquer a vicious habit he will do.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A MOTHER’S SORROWS</div>

<p>The loss of my child sits heavily upon me, my heart is oftentimes
overflowing, and my health very much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span> impaired. The system that
Sr. Walter Farquhar<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> has put me upon is calculated to rouse my
constitution, but grief and a certain natural morbid tendency may
baffle all his endeavours. My Charles is delicate, and has frequent
and severe attacks: anxiety for him and regrets for my poor Ste. make
the hours of reflection and solitude pass sorrowfully over. There is a
sensation in a mother’s breast at the loss of an infant that partakes
of the feeling of instinct. It is a species of savage despair. Alas! to
lose my pretty infant, just beginning to prattle his little innocent
wishes, and imagination so busily aids my grief by tracing what he
might have been. In those dreary nights whilst I sat watching his
disturbed sleep, I knelt down and poured out to God a fervent prayer
for his recovery, and swore that if he were spared me the remainder of
my life should be devoted to the exercise of religious duties; that I
should believe in the mercy of a God who could listen to and alleviate
my woe. Had he lived I should have been a pious enthusiast. I have no
superstition in my nature, but from what I then felt it is obvious how
the mind may be worked upon when weakened and perplexed by contending
passions of fear, hope, and terror.</p>

<p>Ah! my child, perhaps if I had not left you in the summer, but stayed
and watched with maternal care all your little ailments, I might have
had you still; but the disease was inveterate. He was opened, and his
fatal malady ascertained—two tubercles upon his lung, and a pint of
water upon his chest. The surgeon and medical men who attended thought
the disease was inherent, and that nothing could have saved him, but
even in the most inveterate hereditary diseases life is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span> prolonged
to a very advanced period by care. But it is over, and regret is now
superfluous.</p>

<p>An interesting play, taken from the French, is now acting with success
at Drury Lane.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> The story is of a deaf and dumb boy found in the
streets of Paris, who became from his infirmities a pupil of the
celebrated Abbé d’Epée, who discovers great intelligence in the boy,
and from various circumstances suspects he is of high origin, but
abandoned from motives of interest by his family. This he infers from
his distress at the meanness of his clothes, his expressions of delight
at seeing a Chief Magistrate, whom he gives his patron to understand
resembles in dress one who used to caress him. From a variety of
incidents the Abbé at length traces that he is the orphan of a great
magistrate, defrauded of his rights by a false guardian. I only mention
the piece to show the spirit of the times.</p>

<p>The first night it was played, Theodore, the orphan, to show his
talents, is asked to give his opinion who is the greatest genius France
has produced. He replied, in writing, ‘For science, D’Alembert, wit,
Voltaire, sentiment, Rousseau.’ This was deemed Jacobinical, and it
is now strangely transposed, ‘For science, Pascal, wit, Boileau, and
<i>sentiment</i>, <i>Montesquieu</i>.’ This is absurd, but, much as
it is so, the fury of the times is very much abated within these few
years, or rather year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LADY OXFORD</div>

<p>Lady Oxford passed a few days here with her daughter and sisters, and
by a harmless <i>supercherie</i> she contrived that Sir Francis Burdett
should be invited, a scheme I disliked, as she is so gentle and good
that it pains me to see her a prey to him. Knight was here also. To
use a vulgar phrase, he has corrupted her mind by filling her head
with innumerable vain conceits, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span> teaching her to exclaim against
institutions, especially that of marriage, to which she says she has
been a helpless victim. If I were to see much of her she might perhaps
be benefited, for as nobody can do more mischief to a woman than a
woman, so perhaps might one reverse the maxim and say nobody can do
more good. A little mild reproof and disapprobation of some of her
doctrines might possibly rescue her from the gulf.</p>

<p>Soon after Fox’s arrival in March (as mentioned already somewhere
in these scrawls) a negotiation was set on foot to bring together
all the opposers of Governt. to procure a degree of concert in their
proceedings. Tierney was instrumental in getting Ld. Moira and Ld.
Lansdown together. Soon after, a numerous meeting at the house of the
former was held, where Fox, D. of Bedford, Grey, and others all came to
an agreement as to their mode of acting in case of a Regency. The King
recovered unexpectedly and rapidly, and the zealous <i>Patriots</i>
dispersed.</p>

<p>Ld. Moira is offended, and thinks himself ill-used by the desertion of
his new allies, who, immediately upon the chance of getting into power
becoming more distant, each fled and followed his own devices. Tierney
also is discontented, and declares himself no longer a party man,
wishing it universally to be understood that he will not consider Fox
as his leader.</p>

<p>Previous to the King’s illness I was witness to rather an unpleasant
scene at my own house between him and Grey, where the D. of Bedford was
the moderator. The immediate cause of the dispute was that Sheridan
most unjustifiably repeated and <i>added unto</i> a conversation held
over a table when most of the hearers and talkers were drunk. The
origin of the quarrel, however, was more remote. Tierney came into
Parlt. entirely by his own talents, neither owed his election or his
success<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span> in the Committee to the interference of any of his political
friends. Shortly after his becoming permanently seated, secession began
to be rumoured; he had spoken several times, but had not then much
distinguished himself. Fox still attending of course made him diffident
of putting himself too forward, nor probably had he acquired the
facility of speaking or weight enough to claim the notice of the House.
At a meeting held in Mr. Fox’s house upon the measure of seceding, he
offered to resign his seat, adding that he felt it incompatible with
his duty as a member of the H. of Commons to represent a body of people
without fulfilling <i>actively</i> his engagements towards them; and
submitted to the will of Fox what he should do. (Ye D. of Bedford, who
was afterwards displeased with Tierney for his attendance, saying it
spoilt the effect of secession, affects ignorance of this proposal of
Tierney, but Fox himself, Fitzpatrick, and others, but especially the
first, say that Tierney behaved well, because he behaved frankly.)
Fox could not, and did not exact his renunciation of his seat, and
he remained near three sessions alone, unassisted, and unsupported,
Sheridan alone of the Foxites ever attending, and his attendance was as
much directed against Tierney as it was against Pitt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TIERNEY AND GREY</div>

<p>This solitary opposition was of infinite use to T. as an orator and
as a public man; the daily use of his tongue taught him readily to
debate, and his diligence, ability, and plainness acquired him the
respect and confidence of the country. Successful as he was, he wanted
aid; he knew the aristocratical temper of the House was such that the
obscurity of his family would retard his progress, but that assisted
by Grey he could be high and well propped. Grey was a fit subject to
work upon; of an active, restless, unsatisfied temper, of boundless
ambition, he found himself a prey to melancholy in calm retirement.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
Chance threw them together in the neighbourhood of Ham. Tierney did
not fail of encouraging his disposition to return, and strove to
combat his feelings of remorse about Fox, who had merely in compliance
to Grey and ye Duke of Bedford, adopted the measure of secession, a
measure notoriously against his own judgment.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> In short, Grey
resumed his post in Parlt. Things went on smoothly, Grey made some
capital speeches, the divisions of Ministers fell off, but Opposition
gained nothing. Some of Fox’s old friends, the <i>staunch</i> ones
(such as Coke, Ld. J. Townshend, and a few others), were offended at
being written to to attend, replying that no good could be done if Fox
abstained from coming, and that without his presence they would not
attend. Grey, always fickle, and generally desponding, grew soured;
he saw Fox, and at length persuaded him to come up upon his motion
upon the State of the Nation. Tierney, when he knew Fox was coming,
expressed himself strongly upon the absurdity of Grey’s going down to
St. Anne’s to get sense, and imprudently enough at the Friday Club
declared his intention of keeping away on the day of the debate, unless
Fox gave a pledge of his future attendance.</p>

<p>This was the conversation reported by Sheridan to Grey, and brought
forth a burst of rage and indignation from Grey against Tierney. The
expressions used on both sides were alarmingly strong. Upon T. saying
he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span> should withdraw himself, if Fox was to come down occasionally and
Grey was not generally understood to be the leader, G. accused T. of
deceiving him by betraying him into attending by promises of support.
In short, the explanations and accusations were sharp and bitter on
both sides.</p>

<p>The King’s illness put a stop to the question; the motion was put off
from day to day, and Fox came, grew eager, and coalesced with Moira, as
has been mentioned elsewhere. The King’s recovery, like magic, drove
the whole set back to their hiding-places. Some fancied that Fox would
have continued in town but for Mrs. A. and the expense of a house; upon
which it was suggested to Ld. Hd. to hire one for him. This with his
usual alacrity to serve his uncle, he did without hesitation, announced
it to him by letter, and received the following reply.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p><i>April 28, 1801.</i>—When Tierney heard of his determination against
coming, except to Tooke’s business, he told Grey peremptorily that he
should adhere to Ld. Moira and the neutrals. The assurance of attending
Horne Tooke’s question has not added to his popularity. In short, all
are offended with him.</p>

<p class="p-left">Dissentient.</p>

<p>We deprecate and protest against this Measure because,
as far as it may be carried into execution, it tends to
dissolve the allegiance of the subject. A country over
which Martial Law is exercised may be crushed or subdued,
but it is not governed, much less is it practical.
Allegiance is not more a duty on one side than protection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
on ye other; the character of subjects and of enemies
cannot exist together. A military force can exercise
nothing but the dominion of the sword. With respect to the
people there is no government. We, therefore, conceive it
to be our bounden duty, in our endeavours to preserve the
Governt. of the United Kingdom, not to lose sight of those
advantages which alone render it worth preserving.</p>

<p>This protest was entered against the Martial Law Bill for Ireland.
The composition is Francis’s, whose brevity and terseness make the
performance nonsense.<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> Mr. Pitt remarked that the sentence which
asserts the incompatibility of the character of subject and enemy is
the precise definition of a traitor.</p>

<p>This foolish Protest made a great deal of noise; Ld. Clare moved the
expunging it on account of its treasonable and seditious tendency,
which was opposed by 17 peers, some of very respectable characters.
I quarrelled with Francis, and would not make peace with him. His
explanation was worse than the original offence; he declared that he
disapproved of the sentiments, and feared the making them public would
get the protesters into a scrape. Then <i>why</i> abet and assist what
you think mischievous and of bad consequence to your friends?</p>

<p>Ld. Wycombe returned about a fortnight since from Paris, and tho’ he
will not see <i>me</i>, he has entrusted his journal for my inspection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span></p>

<p>‘Paris, which I had known under so many different circumstances, and
which I had originally known in times so very opposite to these. It
is an observation of Thucydides that, in the country of which he was
a native and of which he wrote, the traveller could not take a step
without treading on historic ground. With equal truth may it be said
that it is impossible to traverse Paris, without at each step being
reminded of occurrences which are destined to become the materials of
future history: occurrences which are the more striking, inasmuch as
they have not been received by us on the faith of tradition obscured
by the lapse of ages or gathered from the Annals of our ancestors, but
have taken place within our own memories, have involved the fall of
persons we ourselves have known, have overwhelmed institutions with
which we have been personally conversant, and have already materially
affected the destinies of the generation to which we belong.’</p>

<p>‘The most eloquent discourse cannot half so well illustrate the
character of human passion, the vicissitudes of human fortune, the
vanity of human pursuits, and the instability of human things, as the
aspect of this metropolis.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE INFERNAL MACHINE</div>

<p>‘When we were within a few steps of the <i>Théâtre de la République</i>
we were surprised by an explosion resembling the report of a
cannon.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> On stepping out of the carriage I perceived a column of
smoke making its way over the tops of the houses. In an instant the
rattling of cavalry announced the approach of the First Consul, who
drove by us with rapidity. We entered the theatre lost in conjecture as
to the probable cause of so strange and sinister an incident. We had
but little disposition to attend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span> to the business of the drama, which
was presently put a stop to by the account of that heinous atrocity
which exhibits such a melancholy instance of the most deliberate
depravity, and which had so nearly terminated the transcendent career
of that illustrious man, whose fame will be more durable than the
Pyramids he has visited, whose life is consumed in a succession of
dangers, whose preservation should be dear not only to all good
citizens, but to all good men, whose fortunes may be deemed inseparable
from the fortunes of the Republic. The actor who came forward upon
this occasion made the audience acquainted neither with extent or
particulars of the misfortune which made it indecent to proceed. The
theatre was immediately evacuated; guards were seen moving in various
directions, and the measures of precaution were taken with a degree of
calmness, quickness, precision, and intelligence which served to give
me some idea of the perfection of the military system.</p>

<p>‘No one was able to tell what was the number of persons who had been
killed and wounded; but it was understood that the disaster had
originated in an attempt to destroy the First Consul in his way to
the Opera. At the portico of the Opera, I heard that the performance
was going on without interruption, and that Bonaparte, unmoved, was
partaking of the entertainment, which was an Oratorio,<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> as if
nothing unusual had happened. The next morning heard a few particulars;
some of the manner in which the Chief Consul had conducted himself. He
appears to have expressed a conviction that in his situation and at a
period like the present, such an occurrence was not to be considered as
being justly matter of surprise. He told those who had an opportunity
of seeing him that when, a short time before,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span> his life had been
conspired against, he felt no particular solicitude in relation to the
punishment of a crime which seemed to have him only for its object; but
that now when the blow which was levelled at himself had fallen upon
others, when the safety of a part of the population of the capital had
been actually endangered, and when several individuals had become the
innocent victims of so great an atrocity, he should not hesitate to
demand a law authorising the immediate trial of those who might prove
implicated in its guilt. That as to what regarded himself personally,
he should die with as much glory at the head of the Legislature as
he could do at the head of one of the armies of the Republic. To the
Prefect of the Police<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> he expressed his dissatisfaction with
an asperity which sufficiently proved that he imputed a defect of
vigilance to that department.’...</p>

<div class="sidenote">A REVIEW</div>

<p>‘Went to the Review. In front of the Thuilleries were drawn up the
Grenadiers of the Consular Guard, who had followed Bonaparte to
Marengo, and had from their conduct in that memorable battle been
compared by Berthier to a redoubt of granite. On ye remaining sides
of the square were drawn up other troops. In the centre of the
<i>place</i> were stationed the officers of the <i>État Major</i>
on horseback, whose uniforms and accoutrements were splendid to the
greatest degree. A beautiful cream-coloured Spanish horse, adorned
with crimson velvet, magnificently embroidered in gold, was held in
readiness for Bonaparte. A sudden burst of martial music, issuing from
a profusion of instruments, proclaimed his descent from the Palace. He
wears no plume. He is distinguished by the quietness of his deportment,
the pensiveness of his aspect, and by the paleness of his countenance,
which thought and watchfulness have worn. He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span> attended by his
Mameluke. Mounted on his docile charger, he galloped thro’ the ranks.
The air resounded with acclamations of applause, to which he seemed
insensible. His attention was confined to the troops. When he passed
the colours he saluted with a singular propriety of manner. After
having rapidly inspected the difft. corps, he rode to the centre of
the ground, where he prescribed the evolutions of the day, which took
up very little time. Nothing can exceed the precision and intelligence
with which the whole manœuvre is conducted. I particularly remarked the
fine appearance of the Pioneers, who, as well as the Grenadiers, seem
to be picked men. The flying Artillery is much to be admired, but the
horses of the Dragoons, altho’ active, were inferior in beauty to those
which are commonly purchased for the English Cavalry.’...</p>

<p>‘One of the party had been in the society of the First Consul, where
General Lannes was present, subsequent to the villainous attempt made
in the Rue Nicaise. B. observed that when the circumstance took place
he was a great way off in imagination, that the explosion had been
heard by him without reflection, and that he was first excited to
attend by Lannes, who was with him. General Lannes explained by saying
that he thought at the time, by the breaking of the glasses, that
musketry might be firing at them. ‘Lannes,’ said B., ‘you are not of
the Institute; if you were, you would have known that it was the air
contained within my carriage which broke the windows of it.’</p>

<p>On 16th May, 1801, I dined at Mrs. Sharp’s, in the City, on Irish
Hill, to meet Horne Tooke. He was ill, and in all probability would
not have kept his engagement, had he not been aware that the dinner
was expressly made to give me an opportunity of seeing him, and wise
as he is, he is not free from the frailty of the weak (and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span> oftentimes
of the wise, as in this instance), in possessing a considerable
portion of vanity, for he was gratified at knowing he was sought as a
<i>sight</i>. He is an infirm, exhausted old man, with a mild, placid
countenance, a small penetrating eye, and a flat, broad forehead. His
manners are those of a remarkably high-bred, old-fashioned man of
quality; his sentences are precise, clear, and short. His language
obsolete and affectedly so, but often productive of a happy and
singular effect, witty and brief. He so evidently laboured under the
pressure of bodily pain that he only <i>flashed</i>, but from those
scintillations I could easily perceive what he must have been in his
days of vigour, when his mind, unfettered by physical infirmity, could
give itself full scope. His praises of Mr. Fox were extravagant. He
said: ‘God Almighty has made that man to show his omnipotence.’ He
said to Ld. H.: ‘You see, my Lord, how your uncle has kicked me in the
dirt!’ The answer was puzzling, as it was difficult to know to what
he alluded, but he explained by adding: ‘He makes me despise myself.
He, whom I have abused from the commencement of his political life,
has been the first and only person who stood manfully forth in my
defence.’<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p><i>17th Nov., 1801.</i>—Indisposition and indolence have combined
to prevent my either writing, reading, or thinking for three several
months back—after our return from Worthing. We stayed here about
a month, during which period we went to Ld. King’s at Ockham, to
Roehampton, and dined at Chiswick, and at Dss. of Leinster’s at
Wimbledon. Went to Brighthelmstone, September 15th; stayed there
till October 21st. During that interval<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span> passed 6 days at Ld. Robert
Spencer’s at Woolbeding. I <i>called</i> at Goodwood, D. of Richmond’s,
on our way back to Brighton; returned here October 22nd. Sleep
occasionally at a house we have taken in Albemarle Street for the
play-nights and the late nights in H. of Lords.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MINISTERIAL NEGOTIATIONS</div>

<p>Peace has been made. Pitt continues supporting Ministers; the
Grenvilles are in open opposition.<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> A negotiation has just broken
off between Grey and Ld. St. Vincent, the purport of which was to
bring in G., the Duke of Bedford, and Ld. Moira into the Cabinet. Grey
gave up Fox with a quibble; the others excluded Sheridan, Lauderdale,
and Lansdown; insisted upon maintaining Ld. Clare in Ireland, and Ld.
Hardwick. G. said, if he is kept, we must have a Ld.-Lt.; they would
not agree. Ld. Moira objected to D. of Portland; King could not be made
to give him up. The arrangement, when they came to terms, could not
take place. G. used the D. of B.’s name further than he was warranted,
I suspect. It is all over now; only Tierney remains with Addington.</p>

<p>Fox was given up shamefully. For if ever one man was bound to follow
the bad and good fortunes of another, it is surely Grey, whose vehement
and rash judgment drove the other out of the high post he occupied;
and yet he is the first to negotiate and give him up. Fie, fie, for
such patriots, when they are not true to their friends as private men.
However, Grey is perfectly honest, only violent and irresolute, and
easily swayed by sudden impressions. Pelham<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> is Secretary of State
for the Home<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span> Department: he is married to Lady Mary Osborne, the Duke
of Leeds’s sister, an amiable person, who will no doubt make him happy.</p>

<p><i>H. House, 18th Nov., 1801.</i>—General Fitzpatrick told us
yesterday of a curious circumstance about a copy of Gibbon’s works,
which belonged to Mr. Fox. As a marginal note Fox wrote in the
beginning of the book, ‘This gentleman, on such a day, told me that the
country could not be saved unless the heads of three or four of the
Cabinet Ministers were laid upon the table of the House of Commons.
On such a day, about a week after he delivered that opinion, he was
made a Lord of Trade by those very men.’ Topham Beauclerk, who was a
<i>friend</i> of Gibbon’s, offered him anything for the book, saying:
‘I must soon die, and my books will be sold after my death by public
auction, so Gibbon’s shabbiness will be notorious and perpetuated.’
Some time after, an execution was put into Mr. Fox’s house, and his
goods were seized, but, having been assigned over to Mr. Moore, their
seizure was resisted. There was, in consequence, a trial in the Court
of King’s Bench, and one of the opposite counsel handed up this very
book to Ld. Loughborough, to prove to him that Mr. Fox must have
considered the book as his own, and not as Mr. Moore’s, by the marginal
notes, and that if necessary they should be read in court. Ld. L., who
was a more cautious friend than Topham Beauclerk, gave the book back,
saying it was unnecessary to read them to the court. Ye General was a
party to the bond, and was in court himself when this passed.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Some months, passed in anxiety and grief, have elapsed since I even
thought of this Journal. The winter had nearly proved fatal to
Charles. Illnesses and relapses succeeded each other so rapidly, that
his strength<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span> was almost exhausted, and in February we almost ceased
expecting that he could recover. He did, but to avoid the danger of a
return, we are to pass the ensuing winter in a warm climate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DUKE OF BEDFORD’S DEATH</div>

<p>The death of the D. of Bedford followed. What did not that calamity
cost me! In him I lost the truest and best friend I possessed. His
society was amongst the greatest of my pleasures. I loved and respected
him, and was proud to see intimately the man on whom the eyes of the
public were turned with approbation and confidence. He died as he
had lived, an example to all who saw him. At the close of a medical
consultation about Charles, on ye 28th of Feb., Dr. Vaughan wished me
joy of the success of the operation which had been performed the eve.
before upon the D. of B. Frightened at this I asked an explanation,
and heard from Mr. Knight, the surgeon (who was here for Charles), the
nature of the disease.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>We left H. H. on the 8th of July (1802), with the following persons
belonging to us, ourselves, Charles, Henry Edward,<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> Mr. Allen, Mr.
Howard, and little Marsh, for Paris.</p>

<p>We had apartments taken for us some time before we came; they are very
spacious and convenient, the whole <i>rez-de-chaussée</i> of the Hotel
Beauveau, Faubourg St. Honoré. The next day we went to Maret,<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>
the Minister, to see the parade. The Carrousel has been considerably
extended, and 15,000 troops can manœuvre in it. The explosion of the
infernal machine, by destroying some houses, rendered it more easy
to enlarge the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span> court. The Brazen Horses from Venice are placed upon
the Grille which runs across the Carrousel; they stand separate, and
produce a very poor effect.<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<p>Nothing can be more splendid than the uniforms of the officers, and
the housings of the horses. The Consul rides a fine white Arabian. He
is known amidst his officers by the plainness of his dress and unlaced
black hat. The corps of Mamelukes appeared for the first time; their
sudden and uncombined evolutions give a wildness to their appearance
that shows a little what they must be when attacking in reality. The
town was illuminated in the evening, and as carriages were prohibited
in the streets, we walked, and saw everything with the greatest ease
and facility. There were public dinners given by the Government to some
hundreds of the soldiers at each public garden.</p>

<p>When I first came, I saw much of Madame de Coigny, but latterly less;
she is inquisitive and talkative.</p>

<p>On the 15th of Fructidor, Mr. Fox was presented to Bonaparte, who
seems to have studied how to receive him in a distinguished manner. He
addressed him in a speech evidently got by heart and of course highly
complimentary. The purport was that he was the greatest man of one of
the greatest countries, and that his voice had always been exerted on
the side of humanity and justice, and that to its influence the world
owed the blessings of peace.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ST. CLOUD</div>

<p>On Saturday, the 21st August, 1802, we went with the General,<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>
Ld. Robert,<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> and Frederick,<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>
    and we took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span> Charles to St.
Cloud. It was a palace belonging formerly to the Dukes of Orleans, but
poor Marie Antoinette liked it, and is accused of having exerted her
royal influence to compel the late Duke to sell it, which he did most
reluctantly. She was so partial to its beauties that she was profuse
in her expense to decorate it. In each taste the First Consul imitates
her, as he is so impatient to take possession that the surveyors are
obliged to make the men work all night; and he likes it so much that
no expense is spared to render it a fit residence for the Sovereign
of France. The gallery remains as it was finished by Gaston, Duke of
Orleans, Louis XIII’s brother; only on the panels some of the plunder
of Italy, which was in the Museum of the Louvre, has been placed,
much to their disadvantage, as the gaudy ceiling and rich gilding
kills the colouring of the pictures. They are capital; some of my old
acquaintances out of the Palais Pitti. The apartments that are fitted
up are done in <i>le goût sévère</i>, which, in other words, means a
dark and dingy style. The walls are hung with cloth, and draperies of
cloth edged with magnificent deep parti-coloured fringes are festooned
over it. The colours being generally dark green and brown produce a
solemn effect, and the whole has a sombre military appearance; the
rods of the curtains are finely polished spears. Where the Queen’s
apartments have been preserved, I admire them far beyond those in the
<i>goût sévère</i>, and prefer bright gilding to the heavy mahogany,
and a well-stuffed sofa to a small, hard one. In short, the exchange
is a bad one, <i>les ris et les amours</i> please me, broad cloth and
sphinxes do not. The Library is very pretty, and the books placed in
very appropriate cases, plain and simple, but at the same time rich and
decorated. The gardens are insignificant, but if the Consul continues
to like living there, I doubt not he will find means to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span> extend them,
tho’ as yet I only look upon St. Cloud as a halt on the road to
Versailles.</p>

<p>On Sunday, ye next day, we went with a large party to Versailles, where
we expected to see the <i>Eaux</i> play, but we had been misled. We
dined at <i>Le petit Trianon</i>, formerly a favourite little palace of
the Queen’s, with a garden <i>à l’Anglaise</i>; but what I did admire
indeed is <i>Le grand Trianon</i>, a most noble palace. The centre,
instead of a <i>corps-de-logis</i>, is a peristyle composed of a double
row of large marble columns; the front to the garden is very large and
grand, only a <i>rez-de-chaussée</i>. The garden is thoroughly in the
French style, broad and spacious walks, fountains, alleys, <i>cabinets
de verdure</i>; in short, just what a garden should be near a large
house.</p>

<p>We went from thence to Versailles. What a change from former days!
We walked along the Terrace, and so to the <i>Orangerie</i>, where
there are trees in tubs as large as any I ever saw growing either
at Nice or Naples in the common ground. One old tree they call
<i>François Premier</i>, and they add that it is 400 years old. It is
satisfactorily proved by a <i>procès verbal</i> that it belonged to
the Constable of Bourbon, and was confiscated with the rest of his
property, and so came to François I. Our party was numerous: Mr. and
Mrs. Fox, Ld. Robert, the General, Mr. Allen, Frederick Ponsonby,
Miss Adair, Heathcote, St. John, Trotter,<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> Smith (the Petrarch of
Carolina’s brother), Green.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The following is a list of those who dined with us at Paris in July,
August, and part of September, 1802.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">LA FAYETTE</div>

<p><i>La Fayette</i>, who is indebted to Bonaparte for his liberty, has,
since his return to his native country, resided chiefly upon the small
estate the Revolution has not deprived him of at La Grange. Bonaparte
affected to consult the nation whether he should be Consul for life;
was answered by La Fayette, who wrote a gentle but able remonstrance
upon the subject. Bonaparte was little enough, when an army promotion
took place, to pass over La Fayette’s son and nephew; he has, however,
promoted them since. His son was educated in Washington’s house,
appears very amiable; he was just married.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p><i>Andréossy</i><a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> is the son of an obscure man of Italian
origin, employed by Riquet in the Languedoc Canal. He was born at
Castelnaudary, educated at Sorèze, and served under the <i>ancien
régime</i> as an engineer. He made some campaigns in Italy, went to
Egypt, was there employed upon an expedition to ye Lake Menzalah, and
returned in the vessel which brought the First Consul to France. He has
since been named to ye Embassy of England. He lived very much with us.
He is a plain <i>Militaire</i> in his manner, and if he offends it will
be unintentional, as he is disposed to maintain peace and amity between
the two countries.</p>

<p><i>Caffarelli</i>,<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> brother of a general of the same name<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span> killed
before Acre. He is a fellow townsman and school companion of Andréossy,
and like him descended from an Italian family brought by Riquet to work
at the Canal. He is a remarkably displeasing person in his manner, a
sycophant and court echo of the ante-chamber of Bonaparte; from love
of order and morality always proclaiming that the First Consul and
his wife sleep in the same bed, and that the domestic virtues of a
warrior are more important than his heroic deeds. In short, from him
one collects the disgusting cant which is to be employed by the present
Governt. as a counterpoise to the wild extravagant opinions of atheism
and immorality set afloat under the first constitution of the Republic.</p>

<p><i>Valence</i>,<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> a general who served in the first campaigns under
Dumouriez, a good-humoured, boasting, bluff Papa.</p>

<p><i>Mde. de V.</i>, daughter of Mde. de Sillery, a beauty on the wane,
pleasing and clever.</p>

<p><i>Abbé St. Fard</i>, a son of the Duke of Orleans, father to the
unfortunate <i>Égalité</i>; remarkably obliging, and, tho’ not
distinguished for talents, very popular, and a person one cannot but
like.</p>

<p><i>Duc de Duras</i>,<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> a <i>ci-devant Duc</i> returned, but not
reconciled to the changes in his country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">LALLY TOLLENDAL</div>

<p><i>Lally Tollendal</i>,<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> the epitome of sentiment. By some
inconceivable freak imagined himself to be the son of Count Lally,
executed for the surrender of Pondicherry. Whilst at college he heard
the story; his birth was obscure and even mysterious. A flight into the
region of fancy made him imagine himself the son of the state culprit
(but not till after his execution); he then pleaded for him. He is
returned to France after an absence of many years, but, like many who
were distinguished at first, he returns but to see his insignificance
and the indifference of the Governt. to these, many of whom conceived
themselves to be of the utmost importance.</p>

<p><i>Psse. d’Hesnin</i> [<i>sic</i>], an excellent woman, formerly about
the Queen, attached for many years to Lally.</p>

<p><i>Mde. Flahaut.</i><a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> A volume would not suffice. An agreeable
adventuress, who after failing in various projects, both upon English
and French, at last has closed her tempestuous career by marrying
Souza, ye Portuguese Minister. She has written some pretty novels;
her conversation consists more in a narrative of the good things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span> she
has said than in those she actually does say. Her son, a fine, open
young man. He is handsome and uncommonly engaging in his manners and
countenance.</p>

<p><i>Girardin</i>,<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> an <i>élève</i> of Jean Jacques, and proprietor
of Ermenonville. He was eager in the beginning of Revolution; emigrated
for a short time; is now a Tribune, and intimate friend of Joseph
Bonaparte’s. He is not an <i>Emile</i>, but good-natured. His love
of independence and the naked truth for the sake of truth will never
expose him to the straits a patriot must undergo. He will shift in time.</p>

<p><i>Gallois</i>,<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> a Tribune, uncommonly interesting in his manner,
with a countenance that proclaims his talents and gentle, amiable heart.</p>

<p><i>Abbé Morellet</i>,<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> an old <i>économiste</i>. Sprightly, altho’
he is turned of eighty.</p>

<p><i>Molé</i>,<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> a descendant of the great President of that name. We
knew him well in England; a mild, gentlemanlike young man, very unlike
a young Frenchman.</p>

<p><i>Chevalier Acerbi</i>,<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> an Italian Cisalpine. He travelled to
North Cape, and has published two 4to. vols. of his journey; a clever
man, great facility of languages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span></p>

<p><i>Le Chevalier de la Bintinaye</i>, nephew of the <i>ci-devant</i>
Archbishop of Bordeaux.</p>

<p><i>Marquise de Coigny</i>, celebrated for her wit. Her daughter, a
charming girl.</p>

<div class="sidenote">M. DE NARBONNE</div>

<p><i>Narbonne.</i><a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> The scandalous chronicles of the old Court report
that he is the son of Mde. Adélaïde of France. He is strikingly like
the Bourbons, but depraved as were the manners, it is too repugnant to
nature to credit the whole story. His conversation is brilliant, full
of lively sallies, and, upon the whole, he is one of the most agreeable
persons in society I ever met with. He was Minister of War for a moment
just after the King accepted the Constitution. He is attached to Mde.
de Staël, who has the most uncontrolled dominion over his opinions
and conduct. His person is a more divided property. He used to be
Talleyrand’s intimate friend, but Mde. Grand, finding him averse to her
elevation, by degrees broke the friendship.</p>

<p><i>Ségur</i>,<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> son of the Comte, a promising, rising young man,
married to Mde. d’Aguesseau’s daughter.</p>

<p><i>Young Ségur</i>, a flippant lad, vain of having made under McDonald
a campaign, which he has written, and of having gone, by order of
Bonaparte, with more celerity than was ever done, from Paris to Madrid
and back again.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span> Age and some well-directed rebuffs will be of infinite
service to him.</p>

<p><i>Mde. d’Aguesseau.</i></p>

<p><i>Jaucourt</i>,<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> a Tribune. Under the days of the Court he was
distinguished for his <i>galanterie</i> and <i>dévouement</i> in
affairs of intrigue. There is a famous anecdote of his losing his thumb
not to betray a lady whose house he quitted by stealth at daybreak.
The Swiss heard a noise at the gate, and shut it with violence;
Jaucourt’s thumb was crushed, but he made no noise, and for many years
the adventure was secret. He is now married, according to the licence
allowed by the Revolution, to Mde. de la Châtre. He is an agreeable
man, she is clever.</p>

<p><i>Abbé Casti.</i><a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> I will not do to him what an injudicious
panegyrist has done to Ariosto, whose epitaph is laden with an
enumeration of his works. Suffice it to say that his last work is
inferior to all his others—<i>Gli animali parlanti</i>, a poem as dull
and as ill-conceived as Dryden’s <i>Hind and Panther</i>. <i>Those</i>
discuss polemical questions, and Casti’s reason upon the abstract
principles of Governt. He is very old, and worn out by every species of
debauchery and excess; his eyes twinkle at times, and show a trace of
his former life, but they are but rare scintillations.</p>

<p><i>Rumford</i>, ye Yankee philanthropist. I have often named him
elsewhere.</p>

<div class="sidenote">M. LE CHEVALIER</div>

<p><i>Le Chevalier</i>,<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> a most cordial, warm-hearted, zealous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
man. He travelled to the plain of Troy with Sir Francis Burdett, and
has written upon it, which has given rise to a fresh controversy. He
is employed <i>au Bureau des relations extérieures</i>, merely from
Talleyrand’s friendship for him. His language is not calculated to
obtain him promotion in his career, nor is he trusted with anything,
his place being a sinecure and more a pension than an employment.</p>

<p><i>Monteron</i>,<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> [<i>sic</i>] one of the unfortunate Duke of
Orléans’ set, a complete <i>mauvais sujet</i>, but an agreeable
<i>vaurien</i>. He was one of the Dsse. de Fleury’s husbands, but has
regained his liberty.</p>

<p><i>Markoff</i>,<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> the Russian Ambassador, a <i>rusé</i> diplomat,
scurvily treated by Bonaparte, who seems to make a point of saying
offensive things before him.</p>

<p><i>M. de Grave</i>,<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> an obliging driveller.</p>

<p><i>Abbé Dillon</i>, brother of the Beau Dillon,<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> &amp;c. Knew him in
Paris in 1790, afterwards in Italy and England. A conceited <i>bel
esprit</i>, with too much pretensions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span></p>

<p><i>Calonne.</i> One may say of him as Johnson did of Garrick, that his
loss has removed a stock of harmless amusement from society. He was
delightful; with all the freshness and vivacity of youth, he had the
taste and refinement of riper years. Tho’ he allowed himself to range
in the regions of fancy, when he ought to have been restrained by the
strictness of veracity, yet he did it with such liveliness and wit that
one compounded for the lost fact in hearing the facetious story. He was
<i>murdered</i> by an unskilful physician a very short time after we
quitted Paris.</p>

<p><i>Talma</i>,<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> the celebrated tragedian. His voice is bad, nor is
his conception of his part always correct. He is the person who has
introduced the severity and perfection of costume in the theatre. He is
not clever and not well informed.</p>

<p><i>Abbé Sicard</i>,<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> the successor of Abbé de L’Épée. He brought
with him his most intelligent pupil <i>Massieu</i>. The pains he
bestows upon the unhappy objects confided to his care entitle him to
much praise; the lectures are worth seeing once, but to those who stand
not in need of this assistance are soon tedious.</p>

<p><i>Bertrand.</i><a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> I knew him in Italy. He is a friend of Mde.
d’Albany’s, and belongs to the society of Mde. de Souza, Morellet, &amp;c.,
&amp;c. He is declining fast; he was a lively man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span></p>

<p><i>Charles de Noailles</i>,<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> an uncommonly handsome man, son of the
Prince de Poix. He lived very much in England, and at one time with the
Prince, who grew jealous at Mrs. Fitzherbert’s partiality to him, which
occasioned their rupture. He has much more sense and useful knowledge
than one might suppose from a slight acquaintance with him he possessed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ENGLISH IN PARIS</div>

<p>The English who dined with us were Mr. and Mrs. Fox, Ld. Robert Adair,

<p>The Hollands left Paris on September 20, 1802, for a tour

<p><i>July 24th, 1806.</i>—The Russians have made a separate
peace.<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> The Cabinet have determined upon sending a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span> person upon
an extraordinary Mission to Portugal, and have chosen Lauderdale
for that purpose, and he has accepted. Ld. St. Vincent is to follow
with the fleet, and be joined in the Commission; the nature of the
appointment to be the same as Ld. Minto and Ld. Hood were at Toulon.
It is proposed, if Portugal be invaded, that we should carry off
(<i>vi et armis</i>) the Royal family, and such as choose to follow
their fortunes, and establish them at <i>Brésil</i>. A French army of
90,000 men is assembled at Bayonne for the invasion of Portugal. Eugène
Beauharnais, the Viceroy of Italy, is to have the command of it; the
attack is to be made by Galicia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NEGOTIATIONS FOR PEACE</div>

<p><i>25th.</i>—The preliminaries of peace between France and Russia
have been signed by d’Oubril, though he knew at the time that Basilico
was on his road to Paris with dispatches from our Governt. He signed
three hours after he knew of his landing at Boulogne. The following
stipulations form the basis of the peace. The Russians are to return
Corfu, but they are not to keep more than 4000 men in garrison there.
Dalmatia and Ragusa are left to the French. The Montenegrins are not to
be punished for the successful resistance which, in conjunction with
the Russians, they have opposed to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span> French arms, but this amnesty
does not extend to any offences which they may have committed against
their lawful Sovereign. Sicily is left exposed to the French without
a stipulation in its favour. No provision of any sort is made for the
ex-King of Naples, nor is there any allusion to him in the Treaty,
except a declaration on the part of the French that they have no
objection to the King of Sicily <i>et sa femme</i> (they will not call
her Queen) finding an asylum wherever they can. By a secret article,
Minorca, Majorca, and Iviza are to be transferred from Spain to the D.
of Calabria, on condition that the ports of these islands shall be shut
against the English. The Russians agree to exclude the English from
all their ports in the Mediterranean. The French are to be allowed six
months<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> to evacuate Germany. The present Treaty must be ratified
within twenty-five days.</p>

<p>On the day following this extraordinary transaction, Ld. Yarmouth<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>
presented his credentials to the F. Governt., though his instructions
were not to present them at all, till the basis of the pacification was
settled. This step of Ld. Y.’s is very reprehensible, as it may give
d’Oubril a pretext to justify his conduct.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NEGOTIATIONS FOR PEACE</div>

<p>The terms of peace originally offered by Talleyrand and conveyed to
Mr. Fox by Ld. Y. were very advantageous to this country; indeed, so
extremely so, that as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span> proposals were verbally made, much doubt
was entertained of Ld. Y.’s accuracy in reporting them, and he owed
entirely his being employed in the negotiation to the doubts of his
veracity. The <i>uti possidetis</i> on both sides was to be the basis
of the treaty. Hanover was to be restored to the K. of E., in return
for our acknowledgment of Bonaparte’s newly-created Kings. No further
changes were to be made in Germany or Switzerland. The integrity
of Spain and Portugal was to be guaranteed in both Hemispheres.
We were not to interfere with the settlement of Italy or Holland.
Upon a distant hint being thrown out about commercial arrangements,
‘Nous voulons être maîtres chez nous’ was the reply. When Sicily was
mentioned, <i>Talleyrand</i>, who had spoken the above, exclaimed,
‘Mais que voulez vous? Vous l’avez.’ Our Cabinet readily assented to
these terms (in addition to which it was hinted that Bonaparte was
disposed to concur with Mr. F. in taking measures for the general
abolition of the Slave Trade, but this was intended as a sneer. When
Talleyrand read the resolutions of the H. of Commons upon the subject
of the S. Trade, he said there was another Act of Parliament much more
necessary, one for which the Spaniards, Portuguese, and Germans called
out most loudly, ‘<i>Et cette acte du Parlement, c’est la paix</i>’),
and Ld. Y. was sent back to Paris with full assent to his message.
But when he arrived there he found the views of the French Governt.
materially changed in the most important point. They now demanded
that Sicily should be ceded to them in order to be re-annexed to the
kingdom of Naples. Joseph, the new King, had represented that his
kingdom of Naples would not be secure without the possession of Sicily,
and the French engineers had given in a report that Sicily could be
subdued with much more ease than they had at first supposed. On these
grounds, which the French<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span> have the assurance to represent as <i>new
occurrences</i> since their first overtures to Ld. Y., they pretend to
justify their deviation from their original proposals, and they offered
to the King of Sicily, in exchange for that island, to make him King
of Dalmatia and Albania.<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> D’Oubril, the Russian negotiator, who
was by this time at Paris, and who had been privy to everything done
by our Cabinet, was caught by this last proposal, and expressed his
opinion decidedly in favour of it. In the cession of Dalmatia to the
King of Sicily, he fancied that he saw the elevation of power which
would remove the French to a greater distance from the frontiers of
Turkey, and prove in future a bulwark against the extension of their
empire in that quarter. He was ready, as Mr. Fox observed, to sacrifice
a well-understood English object to an ill-defined Russian one. This
modification of the original project was received here with great
disappointment and ill-humour, and was considered as a breach of faith
on the part of the French. We contended that no event had happened
which could justify any departure from the first proposals. We could
not consent to transfer Albania from its present possessors, who were
the friends and allies of England, in order to make compensation to the
K. of Sicily for the loss of his dominions, which it was equally our
interest and our duty to defend. Dalmatia alone was not to be mentioned
as an equivalent for Sicily. But to show our disposition to accommodate
matters, it was at length proposed as a compromise, that Dalmatia
should be given to the King of Sardinia, with the title of King; and
since the new K. of Naples was desirous to have a greater extent of
sea-coast, that Sardinia, together with the other Spanish Islands of
Majorca, &amp;c., should be added to his kingdom; Sicily on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span> no account
could we yield. The Minute which Mr. Fox drew up for the Cabinet, in
which he states his reasons compressed into 8 or 10 sentences, is the
most able summary ever penned.</p>

<p>In this state of the negotiation, d’Oubril, who a few days before had
reminded Mr. Fox of the expression of ‘<i>piano piano</i>,’ which
he had used in his letter to Czartorisky upon the Grand Confederacy
forming last year, signed the peace, the outline of which I have
just noted. His excuse for this conduct is said to be the danger to
which Russia would be exposed, if they were to persuade Turkey and
compel Austria to join in a coalition against her. Austria is so much
reduced that she must comply with whatever France demands, and French
influence domineers at Constantinople. But these are not supposed to
be the true reasons for his conduct. The late changes in the private
councils of St. Petersburg are suspected to have had a greater share in
determining him, and it is even said that, on the strength of those, he
has ventured to take this important step without instructions from his
Court. He says, ‘He is gone back to lay his Treaty and head at the feet
of his Master.’</p>

<p>Czartorisky,<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> the late Minister of Russia, is a Pole of great
consideration and high rank in Poland. He owed his elevation to the
partiality of the Empress, who was passionately in love with him. He
afterwards became a favourite with Alexander; he played the truant to
his mistress, who was for a length of time quite inconsolable at his
infidelities. The Empress is with child at present.</p>

<p><i>26th.</i>—It is determined to send a military man to Portugal,
and Ld. Rosslyn<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> has been fixed upon for the mission. Ld. H.
immediately proposed to him to take Brougham, if he had any person in a
civil capacity. He promised to propose him to Ld. Grenville. There is
an idea of employing Dumouriez.</p>

<p>Sr. Sidney Smith has taken the Isle of Capri, and the French have
been worsted in several encounters in Calabria. Hopes are entertained
that we shall be able to defend Sicily against the French, with the
aid alone of the Sicilians. The Queen and Duke of Calabria, who are
surrounded by persons suspected of being secretly in the French
interest, are eager for carrying the war into Calabria.</p>

<p>Great dissatisfaction at Ld. Yarmouth’s conduct, and another negotiator
must go. Ld. Holland not being able to leave his uncle, Lauderdale,
as the next best person, is to go. It is a sad mortification, as it
has long been the darling hope of uncle and nephew; but it would be
impossible to go, as Ld. H., besides being useful, is also one of the
greatest comforts to Mr. Fox. Mr. F. so ill that none of the last
transactions of the preceding three days have been communicated to him.</p>

<p><i>27th July.</i>—Mr. Fox stronger, and in better spirits to-day,
but there is no material change in his complaint. The news of the
Russian Treaty, and the determination of sending Lauderdale to Paris,
were communicated to him by Ld. Howick. Upon hearing that L. was to
go to Paris, he exclaimed, ‘Why does not Holland go?’ Ld. Howick
was perplexed, and stammered by way of excuse the ‘suddenness of
the departure’; upon which Fox said, ‘Oh, I understand you!’ and
immediately changed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span> the subject. When he saw Ld. Holland about an
hour afterwards, he began with saying, ‘So, young one, you won’t go
to Paris’; on Ld. Holland’s answering that he preferred staying, as
he thought he was a comfort to him, he caught his hand and said, with
great emotion, ‘Yes, a comfort indeed,’ and was for several minutes
quite overcome and shedding tears. This circumstance is the first event
which has given him any apprehension about his own danger.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD YARMOUTH’S CONDUCT</div>

<p>D’Oubril has written to Stroganoff<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> that he signed the
preliminaries with Ld. Yarmouth’s approbation. Ld. Yarmouth in his
dispatches says quite the contrary. Copies of the letters have been
sent to St. Petersburg. Our Ministers are greatly displeased with
Ld. Yarmouth for having presented his credentials the very day after
d’Oubril signed, and are not without fear that he may be bullied or
won into signing the preliminaries without further instructions. There
are some unpleasant suspicions afloat about Ld. Y., especially upon
the score of stock-jobbing.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> General Clarke<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> is the person
named to negotiate with him; he was employed upon d’Oubril’s business.
The French already show a disposition since the signature of the
Russian Treaty, to rise in their demands. They have thrown out hints
that they expect <i>St. Lucia</i> and <i>Tobago</i> to be restored to
them, and Ld. Y. has of his own head suggested that <i>Cuba</i> should
be ceded to the King of Naples, who cannot be reduced to live as a
fugitive or subject in the dominions of his son. Ld. Y. is suspected
of concealments in his report of his negotiations.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span> A messenger went
off instructing him not to proceed in any way, but wait L.’s arrival.
Notwithstanding their displeasure, Ld. Y. has been joined in the
Commission with Ld. Lauderdale.</p>

<p><i>28th.</i>—Mr. Fox nearly in the same state; his spirits are good,
and he has still great hopes of recovery. He said this morning, ‘I
hope my recovery is not so desperate as peace.’ The news from Paris is
every day less favourable, so much that hints have been thrown out to
Ld. Yarmouth about the restitution of Pondicheri and Surinam, and the
other Dutch colonies in S. America, about the expulsion of the French
Princes from England, and a restraint upon the licence of the journals.
Ministers are much more discontented with Ld. Y. L. has been told in
the most explicit manner by the Cabinet, that if he finds anything in
Ld. Y.’s conduct to disapprove of, he has only to give a hint, and he
shall be recalled.</p>

<p>Bonaparte is elated beyond his usual tone of insolence since he
procured the Russian Treaty; he sent for the Austrian Chargé
d’Affaires, and ordered him to signify to his master that he must
lay aside the title of Emperor of Germany, and yield the precedence
to France, and that he must assent to and recommend the alterations
in the constitution of the Empire, which were proposed to be held at
Frankfort on the 10th August. The Chargé d’Affaires pleaded that he
durst not convey such a message to his Sovereign. ‘<i>Pourquoi votre
maître ne m’envoye-t’-il pas un ambassadeur, et pas un misérable
parlementaire?</i>’</p>

<p><i>29th.</i>—Professor Dugald Stewart, who has just arrived from
Edinburgh, is to go with L. to Paris. Gaeta is taken, and Sr. Sidney
has met with some check in the kingdom of Naples.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> L. had a
conversation alone with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span> Mr. F., in which he opened himself freely.
He said he wished to retire from office till he got better, and to
have Ld. H., whom he had always destined ultimately to succeed him,
appointed to fill his place <i>pro tempore</i>, adding that he had been
thinking of this for some time, but that he had put it off in the hope
of being able to sign the peace before he retired. He bid L. ‘open the
matter to Ld. Grenville,’ and added that he ‘would talk further on the
subject to Ld. Grenville in 8 or 10 days.’ In a conversation which
L. had with Ld. Grenville some time ago, during which they talked of
Mr. Fox’s situation and of the small prospect of any amendment in his
health, Ld. Grenville said, ‘That he hoped his own conduct had been
such as to satisfy Mr. Fox’s friends since the period of their being
connected together, and if that disastrous calamity should happen, and
most disastrous indeed would it be for the country, he trusted, they
would have no reason to be dissatisfied with any future arrangements
that might take place.’</p>

<p>Sheridan, who dined here to-day, begged to talk to me privately. He
said that it was the wish of many of Fox’s friends, whenever the state
of his health should make it impossible for him to attend to the duties
of his office, that Ld. H. should be appointed his successor; that such
an appointment would be regarded by them as a pledge that the Whig
Party was still to be kept up, and its principles maintained; that the
Prince was very eager to have them carried into effect; that he had
spoken to Windham, who seemed to listen with satisfaction. That he,
‘from delicacy, spoke to me instead of to Ld. H., and begged I would
communicate the substance of them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span> to him,’ He told me that George
Byng and the second-rate sort of politicians were very eager upon the
subject.</p>

<p>Cline, the surgeon, has seen Mr. Fox, and declares himself ready to
perform the operation whenever the physicians shall judge it expedient,
as he does not see any reason to think the result more formidable to
Mr. F. than to any other person.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A SUCCESSOR TO FOX</div>

<p>Ld. Howick is full of plans for an Administration, in the event of
Mr. Fox’s retirement, or worse. He takes for granted that neither the
General or Ld. Fitzwilliam would choose to remain in office if F. were
away. He would, in that case, make Whitbread Secretary at War, himself
S. for the Home Department, Tom Grenville the Admiralty, Tierney the
Board of Control, Ld. H., of course, the Foreign Office; and, said I,
‘Pray where do you put Lauderdale, ye first, greatest, and best lord?’</p>

<p><i>31st.</i>—Lauderdale had an interview with Ld. Grenville, and
repeated the substance of his late conversation with Mr. F.; Ld. G.
listened with great attention, but made no reply. Just as L. went out,
he called him back to beg that he would say to Ld. H. that, ‘He had
many times abstained from going to Stable Yard, from an apprehension
that if Mr. Fox should know he was there, he might suppose he was come
upon business and make an effort to see him, which might do him harm;
but that if he followed the dictates of his own inclination, he should
be there every day,’ Tierney and Ld. Morpeth have both expressed to me
very strongly their wishes and the necessity that Ld. H. should be the
<i>locum tenens</i> for his uncle.</p>

<p><i>1st August.</i>—Ld. Rosslyn has written a letter on the subject of
his Mission to Portugal, from which it appears he is not inclined to
undertake the services assigned to him. When Admiral Markham read it,
he observed upon it that, ‘Ld. St. Vincent, when he sees this, will say
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span> fellow has got dung at his heart.’ Not a very elegant or delicate
mode of expression!</p>

<p>It is said that Spain is disposed to a war with France, in consequence
of their having discovered that a plan of partitioning Spain is in
agitation, by which Estremadura and Galicia are to be annexed to
Portugal, and made into a kingdom for the Prince of the Peace,<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>
while the rest of Spain is to be given to one of B.’s brothers.</p>

<p>Mr. Goddard (Ld. Henry Spencer’s friend) arrived this evening from
Paris with passports for Lauderdale. When the passport was required,
Bonaparte exclaimed, ‘What! another passport! Have they not a blank one
already? But this is of a piece with the whole of their conduct during
the negotiation; delay, delay is their object.’ ‘But will you grant
them the passport?’ ‘Yes, and for twenty more if they choose.’</p>

<p><i>2nd.</i>—Lauderdale set off for Paris this evening, with Professor
Stewart, and Mr. Maddison from the Post Office. Ld. H. gave him a
letter to Serra and Prince Masserano.<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Fox better; Vaughan said this morning that there was a greater
assemblage of favourable symptoms than there had been any day since he
attended.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SHERIDAN’S INTRIGUES</div>

<p>Sheridan came here in the evening, and talked over his schemes. He
enlarged greatly upon the state in which the House of Commons would be
left if Mr. Fox were removed from it; deplored the unpopularity of Ld.
Howick, and seemed to insinuate that Petty had been tried and found
unfit for the task.<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> He has some project, all founded upon his
enmity to Ld. Howick and hereditary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span> suspicion of Ld. Henry, to try and
rouse Ld. H.’s old partiality for Canning, and get him and Perceval
into the Administration.</p>

<p><i>3rd.</i>—Mr. Fox not quite so well.</p>

<p><i>4th.</i>—Mr. Fox in high spirits, and talks confidently of meeting
Parlt. in October; approves of an early session in time of war. He
has not the slightest expectation of peace, and expects Lauderdale’s
immediate return.</p>

<p><i>5th.</i>—When Bonaparte was told that L. was coming, he said,
‘Comment! on m’envoye un ancien Jacobin.’ D’Oubril had been shut up for
14 hours with General Clarke, before he signed the Preliminaries. It
is a dexterous way of carrying a point, to weary out a man’s physical
strength, to tame him like a wild beast, to carry your purpose. The
pretext was to carry the business through rapidly.</p>

<p>Ali Pacha<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> of Janina has sent a letter which he received from
Bonaparte, all written in his own hand, inviting him to form a
connection with France. Ali observed he had never received such a mark
of respect and confidence from the English. Bonaparte is steady and
indefatigable in all his undertakings.</p>

<p><i>6th.</i>—Ld. Grenville has proposed to Ld. H. that he should be one
of the Commissioners for settling the points in dispute between this
country and the U. States of America.<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> Ld. Auckland, as President
of the Board<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span> of Trade, is to be the other Commissioner. The Americans
are Messrs. Monroe<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> and Pinckney.<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> Ld. Howick and others
consider this as a delicate opening on the part of Ld. G. to show his
readiness to comply with the intimation he had recently had from Mr. F.
through Lauderdale.</p>

<p>The operation is to be to-morrow.</p>

<p><i>7th.</i>—The operation was performed this morn.; Cline and Hawkins
did it. Sixteen quarts of amber-coloured water was drawn off; he bore
the operation perfectly well, his pulse very little affected, and no
disposition to faintness.</p>

<p><i>8th.</i>—Not so well from nausea and lowness.</p>

<p>Ld. H. has accepted the appointment of Commissioner. Mr. Eden is
the Secretary (by a shabby artifice of his father’s), Mr. Allen the
Assistant-Secretary.</p>

<p>It has been proposed to Tierney to go to Lisbon in the capacity in
which Ld. Rosslyn was to have gone. T.’s intimacy with Ld. St. Vincent
made him be thought of for the service. Ld. St. V. is to follow with
a squadron<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span> for carrying off, if necessary, the Portuguese fleet to
the Azores, and for transporting the Prince Regent and his friends to
Brazil. T. is disinclined, and has refused.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LAUDERDALE’S MISSION</div>

<p><i>9th.</i>—Ld. Grenville sent for Ld. Rosslyn late last night
and renewed his former proposal of sending him to Lisbon. Ld. R.
has accepted, and is to set off to-night. The Commissioners are
Lds. Rosslyn, St. V., and General Simcoe;<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> and, to my great
satisfaction, Mr. Brougham.</p>

<p><i>10th.</i>—Mr. Fox continues very low; a great flow from ye wound,
the <i>anasarca</i> diminishes fast.</p>

<p><i>12th.</i>—No messenger from Paris. It is suspected that some
artifice is used to delay the messengers, in order to prolong the
negotiation, it being a matter of importance to France to keep up the
appearance of a negotiation with England till the changes she meditates
in Germany are completed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NEGOTIATIONS FOR PEACE</div>

<p><i>14th.</i>—Messengers in. Immediately on L.’s arrival he presented
to the F. Governt. a short recapitulation of what had already passed
during the negotiation, recalling to their recollection that the
principle on which the E. Governt. had consented to treat was the
<i>uti possidetis</i>, and reminding them how much this had been
forgotten and departed from in their late demands, and concluding
with the alternative, either to resume the uti possidetis as the
principle of the Treaty, or to send him passports to return to
England.<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> Three days elapsed before any answer was given to this
note. General Clarke proposed that the business should be carried
on by conversations, and not by written notes, which was refused.
He also cavilled at some expressions in L.’s note, but at length
presented a note couched in rather a high tone,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span> complaining that
when the Treaty was far advanced, and that Ld. Yarmouth was on the
point of signing, L. should have been sent over to make inadmissible
pretensions and to disappoint the hopes which all Europe had conceived
of peace. The <i>uti possidetis</i> could not be the basis of the
Treaty, unless the Emperor were to be replaced in the possession of
Fiume, Treviso, and of all the conquests which he had renounced by
the Peace of Presburg. Upon this L. sent for his passports. Three
days were employed in sending from one office to another to obtain
them, without success. <i>M. de Lima</i> (the Portuguese) called upon
him, and implored in the most earnest manner that he would not break
off the negotiation, as this would leave Portugal and Spain exposed
to certain and immediate destruction. No effect being produced by
this manœuvre, and L. persisting in his demand of passports, a 2nd
note was sent, expressed in much more civil and moderate language,
and tho’ <i>denying</i> that the <i>uti possidetis</i> had ever been
admitted as the basis of the Treaty, and declaring that without great
modifications it was inadmissible, but concluding with these words,
‘Mais l’Empereur l’adopte puisqu’il le trouve.’ It is remarkable that
in this note the word <i>adopte</i> was substituted in the Emperor’s
own handwriting, in place of <i>accepte</i> or <i>admet</i>. And in the
date, the 11th had been inserted instead of the 7th, which had been the
original date, so that the note had been detained some days, in hopes
of Lauderdale’s yielding. On receiving this, L. addressed a note to the
French Governt., in which, without taking any notice of the contents
of theirs, he declared he could not go on with the negotiation, unless
he had an explicit assurance from them that he should have passports
at any time within half an hour, for himself or couriers, whenever he
should chance to demand them. This note produced a very civil answer
from Talleyrand,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span> ascribing to accident entirely the blame of the
former delay, and assuring him that it was in no respect owing to any
want of civility to him. Lauderdale returned a second note, in answer
to the former one, that he could not negotiate further, unless the
<i>uti possidetis</i><a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> was distinctly admitted to be the basis of
the Treaty, and that every deviation from it should be considered as
an exception from the general basis of the peace. Things were in this
state when Basilico was sent away.</p>

<p>Ministers, especially Ld. Grenville, are extremely pleased with L.’s
conduct, particularly in his note on the subject of passports, after
he received the second note from General Clarke. A Council was held
immediately, in which it was determined to recall Ld. Yarmouth, and
Basilico was sent back in the evening with an order to that effect. The
reason for this measure:—1st, d’Oubril’s account and Ld. Yarmouth’s
of the conclusion of the Russian Treaty are in flat contradiction.
D’Oubril has written to Stroganoff that he signed the article with Ld.
Yarmouth’s knowledge and approbation. 2ndly, Ld. Yarmouth seems to
have spent some weeks at Talleyrand’s country house last autumn, tho’
he gave Ministry to understand that he was hardly acquainted with him.
3rdly, Ly. Yarmouth is very much connected with Monteron,<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> an agent
of Talleyrand’s, and employed in his office.</p>

<p>Favourable accounts of the disposition of the new Russian Governt.
towards this country; Stroganoff has received letters to that
effect from the new Prime<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span> Minister, <i>Budberg</i>,<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> in which
he expresses very strongly Alexander’s high opinion as well as his
confidence in Mr. Fox. Stroganoff thinks Russia will <i>not</i> ratify
d’Oubril’s preliminaries.</p>

<p>Ld. Granville Leveson arrived this day from Petersburg, dined here,
and is looking handsomer than ever. I have not seen him these four
years.<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<p>American Commissioners very amicable; disposed to settle the
differences, and to conclude a Treaty of Commerce between the two
countries.</p>

<p><i>20th.</i>—Ld. Howick dissatisfied with Sr. J. Borlase Warren, who
lost three days after he got orders to sail, and wasted three more at
Madeira, instead of going straight to ye W. Indies, by which Jerome
may escape.<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> Alderman Prinsep did not know how to open the Stock
Exchange.</p>

<p>Alas! Mr. Fox begins to fill again; they talk of another operation in
three weeks.</p>

<p>Lauderdale is abused at Paris, and represented as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span> having deserted Fox.
Goldsmid is supposed to be Ld. Yarmouth’s agent in the Stock Exchange,
and to have transacted business for him to a great amount. Narbonne was
admonished not to visit L. so frequently, Fouché sent for him to that
purpose. Emperor gone to hunt, his Ministers rejoice at his absence
whilst in so violent a mood; they call him <i>bête féroce</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FOX’S HEALTH</div>

<p>Second operation performed on Sunday. Bore the operation extremely
well; less water taken from him than on the former occasion, but he
was more completely emptied. Some pints of water which had remained
in ye abdomen were drawn off; fell soon after into a state of languor
and depression, but the physicians flattered themselves he had gained
strength in the interval between the operations, and that he would soon
be able to bear the course of medicines which they judged necessary
for his recovery, and in this hope they remained until Monday, the
7th September. Water had, in this interval, flowed repeatedly from
the wound in the abdomen, and the quantity of urine discharged had
augmented. They said there was a greater assemblage of favourable
symptoms than had appeared since they had been called in.</p>

<p>Sunday, ye 6th September, Vaughan thought that he felt some hardness
in the region of the liver, which made him speak much more doubtingly
to Ld. H. about Mr. Fox’s recovery than he had done the day before. On
Monday as he was led about the rooms at Chiswick<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> to look at the
pictures, a <i>gush</i> of water burst from the wound, which had been
closed for some hours; he fell into a state of alarming weakness, and
continued so the whole of that and the succeeding day. A catch in his
breathing. We were sent for, and reached Chiswick by two, and found
him in this deplorable state. He was low,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span> and never spoke willingly,
but every now and then got up in consequence of some irritation in his
bowels. He swallowed nothing but brandy, usquebaugh, and other strong
cordials; his senses and understanding never left him, tho’ he spoke
very little till Wednesday, when he reminded Ld. H. of a promise made
to him in Stable Yard, of telling him when he was in danger. It was a
painful duty, but he fulfilled it, and told him what the physicians
thought. He thanked him with his usual tenderness.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, about 4, he began to revive, and during the night, whilst
Ld. H. was sitting up with him, carried on a conversation in French,
that his servant, who was present, might not understand it, as it
regarded Mrs. Fox, &amp;c. He had a few hours rest, and continued to get
better. In the course of the morning he was wheeled into an adjoining
room, and put on his spectacles to look at a caricature which Ld. L.
had sent from Paris. I went into the room, kissed his hand, and he
spoke kindly to me. During this amendment, he told Ld. H. he had never
been in such danger as the physicians had apprehended. He had said on
Tuesday night to Vaughan, ‘I have had a sad struggle for it, do you
think it will do?’</p>

<div class="sidenote">FOX’S DEATH</div>

<p>On Friday morning he became languid without any apparent cause, and
continued afterwards to sink without any interruption. His senses were
good, but he used the wrong word to express his meaning, and seemed
hurt that he could not find the right one. On Saturday death was fast
approaching; his pulse became every moment feebler, but still regular,
his breathing was deep, his strength gradually failing. Mrs. Fox sat
upon the bed, holding his hand; he looked upon her with that sweet
smile so expressive of all the benevolence and goodness of his heart.
He articulated distinctly, ‘I die happy’;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span> his last words were, ‘Bless
you, I pity you.’ He died without a struggle or groan at ¼ before 6
o’clock, on Saturday, the 13th September, 1806.</p>

<p>The scene of unaffected grief was awful; every room contained a friend
who shed unfeigned bitter tears. Ld. Fitzwilliam was so overcome that,
for some time, it was feared he would follow the fate of his beloved
friend. Ld. Holland and General Fitzpatrick immediately went to Mrs.
Fox. A sad scene ensued. She wished the whole family should remain
as long as the body continued at Chiswick; accordingly ourselves and
the General continued until — September. His body was examined by
Mr. Cline. Ld. Howick was at Chiswick, and sent off a messenger to
Windsor. The first account of Mr. Fox’s danger was communicated to
Ld. Grenville by Petty, on Monday night, the 8th Sept., and he was
very much affected on receiving the intelligence, which was quite
unexpected. When informed of his death by Ld. Howick, he inquired what
was proposed for his funeral, and when told that Ld. Holland had given
orders that he should be buried in the family vault at Foxley,<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> he
expressed his disappointment, and asked Ld. Howick what he thought fit.
Finding they were of the same opinion, he offered to recommend to the
King that a public funeral should be ordered. However, the private and
political friends thought it more consistent with the simplicity and
dignity of his character that he should be attended to the grave by
his friends, public and private, without the interference of Governt.,
and an application signed by many of the friends was addressed to Lord
H., begging that he might be interred in W. Abbey, and attended by his
friends.<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span></p>

<p>The answer of the King to Ld. Howick’s notification of Mr. Fox’s death
was in the coldest possible style, and did not express even sorrow for
the event. When Ld. Grenville told him that he had given the Seals
to Ld. Spencer, he approved of it, and added that there was no hurry
about disposing of them, and recommended Ld. Grenville to take his time
(considered as an intimation to take in the Pitts). He received Ld.
Howick very coldly, and made the inquiries about Mrs. Fox from ye other
Ministers.</p>

<p>A communication from Ld. Grenville through Ld. Howick to General
Fitzpatrick to take Ld. H. into the Cabinet. Ld. Howick acknowledged
Ld. Holland was the fittest to succeed in the Foreign Department,
but that he could not undertake to lead in the H. of Commons if he
remained at the Admiralty, the fatigue being too great. T. Grenville
grumbled at the Admiralty, as the public looked to Ld. Spencer if a
change were necessary, besides disliking the duties of the office.<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>
Ld. Grenville wanted Tom to lead the H. of Commons; and there was
a proposal of his being made Secretary for ye Home Department, and
Windham kicked upstairs by a peerage, in order that he might, when Ld.
Howick goes to the Lords, be considered as the head—impracticable from
T. Grenville’s coldness of character, and, I think, want of the right
stuff in his head.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CABINET CHANGES</div>

<p>The strongest reason which the Grenvilles have for proposing the Whigs
to the Opposition in forming a new Administration, is that they can
depend upon them in case of a quarrel with the King, which they could
not on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span> such men as Hawkesbury and Castlereagh. They are out of humour
with Windham. On ye 19th September they proposed the peerage, and hoped
he might bite at it, to escape from the Norfolk election, which will be
strongly contested. Peace perhaps might be easier with Whigs, but tho’
Ld. Grenville is strenuous for peace, there seems to be very little
hopes of attaining it at present.</p>

<p>Prussia has offered to go to war with France, and, with the concurrence
of Russia, to guarantee Hanover to the King of England. Ld. Howick is
very warlike. Whitbread has been absurdly extravagant in his views and
demands; talks of the Cabinet!</p>

<p>Ld. Holland has agreed to accept the Privy Seal, with a full
understanding, however, with Ld. Howick, that his views are directed
to the Foreign Office, and that he only accepts this insignificant
charge to serve the party, and satisfy that part of his uncle’s party
who might suspect the Grenvilles, were he overlooked.<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> All this
was subject to the approbation of the Prince of Wales and his uncle’s
friends. He stipulated that in case of peace, he might resign in favour
of Lauderdale, and go, if he chose, to Paris. Ld. Grenville agreed
to his changing Privy Seal for Paris, and that Lauderdale might come
in; not otherwise, as retiring from office would be injurious to the
Governt.</p>

<p>An affectionate letter to Ld. H. from the Prince, expressing his wish
that Ld. H. might be successor to his uncle in the Seals.</p>

<p><i>20th.</i>—A letter of Murat to the King of Prussia, addressing
him by the style of ‘Mon Frère,’ is said to have been the origin
of these movements of the Prussians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span> against France.<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> Another
is that Lucchesini has discovered, and communicated to his Court,
Bonaparte’s scheme of annexing the Prussian States in Westphalia to
Murat’s dominions. Some think Lucchesini is capable of having made
this communication on the suggestion of Bonaparte, who would be glad
of a pretext to reduce the Prussian power. The Prussians and Saxons
are 240,000 ready to take the field. The French 220,000 to oppose
them. Prince Louis,<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> son of Prince Ferdinand of Prussia, is the
person who has the most hostility against France, and who is eager for
military renown. Austria is determined to remain neutral.</p>

<p>Windham peremptorily refused the peerage. When he talked to Petty of
the proposal, he mentioned it as being whimsical, that, as the great
distress was the want of talent in the H. of Commons, they should
therefore move their best speaker into the House of Lords.<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> Ld.
Howick is <i>now</i> desirous of retaining the Admiralty; he is
satisfied of the impolicy of giving up such a mine of patronage, and
has, in idea, been long enough in possession of the Foreign Office to
be weary of it, but unluckily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span> it is too late. The Foxites have not
<i>one</i> office which has patronage annexed to it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE NEW CABINET</div>

<p>The plan is finally fixed:—Mr. Grenville, Admiralty; Ld. Howick, F.
Department; Ld. H., Privy Seal; Ld. Sidmouth, P. of the Council; Ld.
Fitzwm., Seat in Cabinet, without office; Tierney, Board of Control.
Ld. Howick had a thousand <i>freaks</i>, for they were too wild to be
called plans, the burthen of which was that if he could not do things
his own way, he would go out. He assured Ld. Holland through the
General, and to <i>himself</i> also, that he considered himself merely
as <i>locum tenens</i> during the period of his being in the H. of
Commons, and that his being in the office ought not to be considered
as an obstacle to Ld. H.’s views, he knowing also what Mr. Fox’s
intentions had been upon that subject. In short, as far as professions
and assurances can go, we must feel satisfied that he will make the
offer when he is removed to the H. of Lords. The General says, ‘I have
no doubt he is sincere now, but when the impression of Fox’s loss wears
away, perhaps his intentions may change.’</p>

<p><i>22nd.</i>—Messenger from Lauderdale. He has had a severe bilious
attack, caused, D. Stewart thinks, a good deal by the sad tidings
from England. Talleyrand full of overstrained civility. England,
he said, had a right to dictate her own terms, she being in a most
commanding station. France has only to be careful not to concede too
much. They want to have back Surinam and Demerara. L. has demanded
Cuba in exchange. Capture of Buenos Ayres produced little sensation
at Paris.<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> Emperor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span> left Paris. Ld. Morpeth is to go to Berlin
immediately.<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<p><i>25th.</i>—In consequence of Ld. M.’s declining to go on acct.
of the shortness of notice, Ld. Henry Petty having expressed some
desire to go, Ld. Howick gladly caught at it, and it was mentioned to
the King. Upon Ld. Holland hearing of it, he did his utmost, both in
conversation and by letter, to dissuade Petty, who was so much shook
by Ld. H.’s arguments that he was as eager to seek a pretext to avoid
going as he had been before to get one to go, and he availed himself of
some difficulties about putting the Seals into commission. Ld. Carlisle
wished Morpeth to go, and accordingly he has agreed, and very kindly is
to take B. Frere<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> with him, whom he will leave, in case he comes
away, as Chargé d’Affaires, which will be getting B. F. employment, and
perhaps a grade hereafter.</p>

<p>Lds. Grenville and Howick wrote to the Prince after Mr. Fox’s death.
His answer to Lord Howick was that he wished for no change but that
Ld. Holland should have his uncle’s Seals. But, being in the meantime
informed of the arrangements agreed upon, he wrote to Ld. G. that his
political interest was buried in the grave with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span> Mr. Fox, but that, as
it was probable he might at some future time be again forced to public
matters, he thought it proper to say that he was ready to give his
support to the present Administration, on acct. of the friends he had
in it, and that he should always look to ye friends of Mr. Fox, and
particularly to Ld. H., as his own political friends.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD HOLLAND’S POST</div>

<p>The Duke of Bedford in writing, and the D. of Norfolk in conversation,
have also expressed to Ld. H. that they look upon him as his uncle’s
representative in the Whig Party. Ld. H. stipulated, as it was his
uncle’s wish, that the first blue ribbon was to be given to the D. of
Norfolk. Agreed to.</p>

<p>Ld. Holland strenuously against sending any person to Prussia, but to
allow whatever business there may be to be transacted by the Minister,
Jacobi,<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> who is at Hambro’ [<i>sic</i>] on the part of Prussia, and
by Mr. Thornton on our part, our Minister at Hambro’.</p>

<p>On the 10th October, the funeral of Mr. Fox. He was accompanied to the
grave by his old friends, public and private, and by the Ministers. I
was present in a gallery erected for me in the Abbey over the grave.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><i>12th December, 1806.</i><a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>—The fragment of the Prussian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span> army
may amount altogether to about 50,000 men. Old Kalkreuth, who made
his escape after the Battle of Auerstadt, is in Dantzic with 12,000.
The King is not at Petersburg, but whenever he is, his councils are
directed by Haugwitz more than ever, which makes him perfectly nugatory.</p>

<p>The Russian Proclamation, which declares the necessity of Wallachia
and Moldavia being occupied by their troops,<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> has excited alarm
and distrust in the Austrian Cabinet. Those Courts are wrangling about
punctilios, just as if Bonaparte were not alive. The Austrians want
to coalesce with Russia, but they are afraid and undecided; however,
Pozzo di Borgo, who is in the Russian Military Service, is despatched
to Vienna to see whether he can bring about any co-operation. Little
can be expected even if he does, Bonaparte has so completely secured
his rear and kept a communication with France by means of menacing and
cajoling, that all attempts against him are idle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">KING OF SWEDEN</div>

<p>The King of Sweden, tho’ very wrong-headed, and ill-gifted with that
rare commodity common sense, has some notion of honour and high sense
of it. Bernadotte, either at Altona or Hamburg, made some overtures to
the Swedish Minister, saying that Bonaparte had always considered the
King of Sweden as the only high-spirited Monarch; talked of the old
alliance between France and Sweden, and threw out hints of Bonaparte’s
willingness to give him Norway. The only notice the K. of Sweden
bestowed upon this was a severe reproof and recall of his Minister for
listening to any proposals from the French, and giving instructions
to have the whole proceeding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span> laid before the Danish Government, in
order to show them the perfidy of the French, who were soliciting their
friendship.<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> Our Government intend to augment his subsidy, and hold
out a prospect hereafter of giving him ships to assist in the conquest
of an island, Martinique or Guadalupe. The Danes are terrified, and
will yield Holstein if the French should be peremptory; not, it is to
be hoped, with impunity on our part.</p>

<p>The Opposition are full of jokes against Tierney; they say the
dissolution was entirely his scheme, that by its suddenness they might
be taken by surprise and unprepared, but that it appeared that he
himself was the least prepared, and the most surprised. He lost the
Borough.<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>

<p>An abundance of speculators have gone with English goods to Buenos
Ayres, enough to make a glut in the market, and merchants have sent
over, it is said, to buy English goods, as they will be quite a drug
there. Auchmuty<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> is gone with considerable reinforcements thither.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span></p>

<p>General Craufurd’s<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> expedition is to land at Val Paraiso in the
South Sea; it was delayed so long that the passage by Cape Horn
would be impracticable, therefore they must go round the Cape, a
voyage of eight months. This expedition was delayed on account of the
negotiation. Peace was once expected, but even then it was a mistaken
policy, in my humble opinion, as Bonaparte is an enemy who will respect
you more, if you will not only show your teeth but bite with them too.</p>

<p>The Government of the United States has detected the conspiracy which
has long been gathering to break off the Northern from the Southern
States, and so to make the Allegany Mountains the boundary. Mr.
Burr,<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> who killed General Hamilton, is the head of it, and orders
have been given to arrest him. General Wilkinson with the army is in
the South and declared for Burr.</p>

<p>Burr laid the whole plot open to our Minister, and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>asked the

Mulgrave,<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> who, as usual, returned no answer.</p>

<p>Ld. Grenville calls the American a <i>Mob Government</i>, and one too
weak to carry its own measures into effect.</p>

<p>The Scotch Peers elections have gone well; Ld. Melville was cruelly
disappointed, he expected to carry four, and only carried Ld. Aberdeen.
Kinnaird behaved imprudently and foolishly; however, Ld. Lauderdale’s
dexterity and activity carried him through. Till the very moment before
the election, Lord Melville reckoned upon carrying <i>four</i>.</p>

<p>Deliberations in the Cabinet upon an attack on Mexico; Ld. Grenville
sent to Ld. H. Sr. Arthur Wellesley’s plan.<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> Sir Arthur Wellesley
appears to have obtained all his information with respect to the
accessible points for attacking S. America, New Spain, from a Mr.
Frazier.</p>

<p><i>18th December.</i>—Lauderdale entertains no doubt whatever that
the note so very offensive in its language to him was written, and
also that it was written by the Emperor himself; and, moreover,
that the Ministers, to avoid a severe reprimand from him for having
ventured to suppress it, have thus impudently ventured to publish it
officially. The other speculation is that the order for the publication
of the correspondence was sent from Berlin, and the clerks published
<i>all</i>, <i>brouillons</i> included. This is the most probable.</p>

<p>The melancholy year of 1806 died with another loss: the D. of
Richmond<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> died at Goodwood of suppressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span> gout and a liver
complaint, discovered only after death.</p>

<p>News of the recapture of Buenos Ayres believed by the Government. It
rests upon the declaration of a Portuguese Captain, who reached Lisbon
in 43 days from Pernambuco; he says a Spanish schooner came in there
dismasted, who was the bearer of dispatches to Old Spain, giving an
account of the retaking of the town after a severe contest. It must
be highly gratifying to Ld. Howick that he should have made his manly
exposition of Sr. Home Popham’s improper conduct before this news, when
the shabby people will be as ready to cry against the business, as they
have been ready to praise it. An instance of the money-getting spirit
of Sr. Home came to my knowledge lately. He wrote to the merchants
at Manchester advising the exportation of certain goods, but to his
own agent he bid him send him, upon speculation, a large quantity of
silk stockings, with a hint that this order should not transpire. B.
Frere assured me he was acquainted with the silk-stocking merchant who
supplied the articles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD ELDON AND THE KING</div>

<p>The business of the Princess,<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> which is now before the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span> Cabinet, is
highly perplexing, and from the answer given by the K. to the Minute
of the Cabinet, there is good reason to suspect he has some secret
advisers. The style is much too business-like, and shows too much
knowledge of law to be his own. This suspicion is confirmed by the line
of conduct taken in the H. of Lds.; it is quite distinct from Canning’s
in the H. of Commons, as they did not move the Address. Ld. Eldon
had for many years the management of the D. of Portland’s estates;
in consequence of which, he had frequent access to him, and thereby
acquired considerable influence over his mind. The King has appointed
the D. of Portland his Master of his own private Monies. Thus upon
pretence of his private affairs, the K. has a channel of communication
with Ld. Eldon, which Ministers can in no way get at or interfere with.</p>

<p>There are avowed schisms amongst the Opposition; Canning is distinct
from Perceval, and from Castlereagh. If the <i>great man</i> of all
does meddle in the H. of Lds., those in the Commons are not entrusted
with the secret of his benign influence.</p>

<p>A curious petition under the Treating Act against Messrs. Windham and
Coke, curious because it is not brought by the rejected candidate, who,
on the contrary, declares he is not privy to the petition. It is the
result of female spleen and revenge, a retaliation upon Mr. Windham for
an election trick played by his party against these incensed heroines,
Mesdames Atkins and Berney.<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span> They had induced some electors to
come forward and petition under the Treating Act; the three candidates
unwisely consented to treat, not suspecting mischief could ensue from
any other quarter. Mrs. Atkins was a celebrated actress, formerly of
the name of Walpole. Her coadjutor is as great a virago as herself.
‘<i>La vengeance est douce à l’esprit d’une femme.</i>’ Windham had a
double return, so will sit for some rotten borough. Serjeant Lens, who
is his counsel, rather despairs of making out a defensible case.</p>

<p>The expedition of General Craufurd, which was <i>not</i> to take
Teneriffe on its way to the S. Sea because it would take too much time,
is now loitering and beating off the Cape de Verd Islands for want of
convoy, which convoy has not at this moment quitted England.</p>

<p><i>January 4th, 1807.</i>—The American Treaty is at length signed; it
must go to the U. States for ratification before it can be made public.
The only point gained is the settling the ill-humour, and fixing the
continuous voyage;<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> the seamen question is still unsettled.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEBATE ON THE NEGOTIATION</div>

<p><i>6th January.</i>—Last night upon the subject of the negotiation,
Whitbread took the most hostile line against Government, arguments
mingled with invective against their conduct from the beginning
to the end of the negotiation. He <i>applauded</i> Ld. Yarmouth’s
proceedings,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span> censured the recalling him, as well as the motives
assigned for it, and found fault with everything done by Lauderdale;
concluding the whole in the most personal manner to Grey, by moving
the <i>same</i> amendment that Grey himself had moved on the Address
to the King when Ld. Whitworth’s papers were under consideration.<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>
Ld. Yarmouth, conceiving himself to be the injured party, spoke with
warmth against Ministers; Perceval, with bitterness and scurrility
against Fox. This strange conduct of Whitbread’s will be productive of
great mischief, and unfortunately Ld. Holland, from an apprehension of
being overcome if he risked mentioning his uncle’s name in public, did
not speak on the night of the debate in ye House of Lords. His silence
and Whitbread’s garrulity will corroborate the French story of the Fox
party being discontented with Lauderdale’s conduct. This, however, can
and will be justified immediately by his speaking, with or without an
opportunity.</p>

<p>During the debate L. sat next to the Prince, who seemed mightily to
relish Ld. Yarmouth’s occasional raps at the Grenvilles, and shortly
after opened very freely upon his dissatisfaction; told him to sound H.
upon the subject of the Pss., in which he spoke as if he suspected he
was <i>given up</i>, and to ascertain whether, if so, he, Ld. H., was
prepared to go out upon it; deeply deplored the loss of Fox, who was
a <i>man</i>, fair, open, and attached. L. collected, which combined
with other circumstances that had come to his knowledge, that Ld. Moira
is playing a deep game, by trying to draw a line in the Cabinet of
Prince’s friends and Grenville’s. He has never recovered the double
disappointment, first, of not being made First Lord of the Treasury
and Patron of Scotland, and, secondly, of not being acknowledged the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
successor of Fox in the Whig party. That is to say, the Prince styles
himself the head of the Whig party, in imitation of his uncle, the D.
of Cumberland, who was so in 1764, forgetting how foolish that was, but
how much more foolish it is in an Heir Apparent! However, with this
idea thrust upon him by Ld. Moira, he is the more likely to concur
with Moira’s views, who would content himself with being styled his
assistant upon such an assumption.</p>

<p>Ld. Holland dined at the India House where Ld. Minto had been sworn
in;<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> Ld. M.’s spirit excessively depressed. If annoyed at going,
why seek the appointment by such means?</p>

<div class="sidenote">WHITBREAD’S SPEECH</div>

<p><i>7th January, 1807.</i>—A universal groan, a spontaneous, unanimous
feeling of disgust in the H. of Commons, when Perceval attacked the
character of Fox. The tune of it was that all the kingdoms of Europe
had sunk by treachery, bribery of their principal persons; that
Talleyrand, the base, corrupt Prime Minister of France, had been the
agent; yet this <i>immaculate</i> character was the <i>attached</i>
friend of Mr. ——.<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> The House shuddered, and interrupted the
pronouncing of the name. He animadverted upon the correspondence
carried on between them. Whitbread’s speech made a considerable
impression upon some of the most valuable men in the House, but was not
conclusively reasoned; he having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span> completely overlooked the necessity
of keeping faithful to our allies, the Russians. Some think that the
greatest mischief done by his speech was the drawing out some very
warlike sentiments from Grey, who answered both injudiciously and
inconsistently (with former declarations) with regard to the duration
and principle of the war, which he stated with all the exaggerated
declamation of a pupil of the Pitt school. This is a most unfortunate
error, and is the more to be regretted, as the case upon ye papers was
so strong, and might have been defended upon the true principles of Mr.
Fox’s pacific policy.</p>

<p>Roscoe<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> spoke yesterday for his maiden speech on the Thetford
Petition: Windham says his manner is dull, coarse, and provincial. I do
not think his talents are such as will enable him to <i>add</i> to his
reputation by his public speaking.</p>

<p><i>February 8th.</i>—Serjeant Lens called to give me an acct. of the
state of Norfolk Committee. Windham is in great agitation, even beyond
what such a circumstance ought to excite. <i>His</i> imprudence has
been quite incredible; however, nothing decisive has yet appeared
against him. There were two of his indiscreet letters afloat; one has
been rescued, but the other is still in the hands of the enemy—the
one of the most mischievous purport unluckily. Each letter was a
threatening to dismiss the persons, to whom they were addressed, from
their employments, if they did not vote, and in the one in the field
Ld. Grenville’s name is used.</p>

<p>Prince came and stayed a considerable time. He is looking less ill than
he did a month ago. Ld. H. advised him to do nothing about the Pss.,
telling him in as civil terms as he could that his unpopularity in the
country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span> was so great, that any publication of proceedings on his part
would only confirm the belief in a conspiracy against her. He also
advised him to conciliate the Duke of Gloucester,<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> whose ambitious
views of alliance with the young Princess were apparent, and tho’ not
necessary to encourage, were worthy at least of observation, as he
might secure his friendship by civility. He expressed great abhorrence
of him, said he was a fool and a Saint: said it had often occurred to
him that his brother, the Duke of Cambridge,<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> would be a proper
husband for his daughter, that such connections were common amongst
Catholics, and that Parliament could grant a dispensation as fully as
the Pope. He has promised to take no steps without consulting his legal
advisers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD MINTO’S PAPER</div>

<p>Ld. Minto came to take leave, he was to set off for India in half an

which was drawn up by him and Burke on the King’s recovery in 1789,
in which they had entered fully into the Queen’s conduct during H.M.
illness.<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> Ld. Minto was extremely disturbed, and hardly knew how to
reply. He stammered and said it was of no use, such a paper now would
be of no service, except <i>historically</i>. However the P.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span> pressed
him so hard, that he was compelled to acknowledge that it was in Ly.
Minto’s possession.</p>

<p>Prince had been at Windsor the night before. King’s blindness worse:
great flightiness upon two topics, upon the name of Sir Sidney Smith
being mentioned, and upon the Irish bishops, whom he said were all
Catholics and should never preach before him. P. seems to have been
greatly struck at the Pss. observation, about four months after
their marriage, on Soulavie’s <i>Memoirs of Catherine</i>, whom she
said was a great princess, and served for an example ‘<i>à toutes
princesses</i>.’ He seriously believes that it has passed in her mind
to adopt Catherine as a model, and as a proof he declares that she wore
usually men’s clothes, and received many navy officers in that attire
at Plymouth.</p>

<p>A Cabinet on the 9th in consequence of letters from ye Duke of

some of the eager ones persist in laying it before Parliament this
Session. Ministers are urged to determine speedily what is to be done

coming forward. He thinks nothing will satisfy the C. at present short
of three concessions:—</p>

<p>1. The insertion of the same clause in their favour in the Mutiny Bill
of England, that was inserted some years before the Union in the Mutiny
Bill of Ireland.</p>

<p>3rdly. Their admission to Corporations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CATHOLIC QUESTION</div>

<p>The Cabinet determined upon granting the first, but object to the
second, as a point that involves the whole Catholic Question and
is objectionable on the same grounds with their total exemption,
without being attended with the same advantages to themselves. The 3rd
must depend upon individual Corporations. The Ministry have already
declared, and are ready to repeat their wish, that the Catholics
should be in full possession of every advantage secured to them by the
existing laws. Such the Government of Ireland has shown to be the wish
of the Ministry, and it is only by continuing the same system, that the
object of procuring the admission of Catholics into the Corporation
can be attained. The sketch of a letter to the D. of Bedford was then
read, and agreed to be submitted to the King. Besides the topics
already mentioned, it referred to an understanding that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span> prevailed in
Ireland when the proposed clause of the Mutiny Bill was carried in the
Irish Parliament by Lds. Clare and Hobart, that a similar clause would
be inserted in the English Mutiny Bill. Very doubtful whether the K.
would consent; also doubtful how far many of the members would continue
to persevere in pressing it upon him. A proof of his indisposition
towards Catholics:—in a private audience with Ld. Howick, he expressed
surprise at the conduct of the Elector of Saxony, whom he had hitherto
considered an honourable man, ‘tho’ nothing better can be expected of a
Catholic, but a man must be greatly degraded to break an oath. I would
sooner submit to be trampled upon and killed.’</p>

<p>Determined, if the others would not press the matter, that Lds. Howick,
Henry Petty, and Holland should go out. Some think that the trifle
required is sufficient to produce the relapse of insanity, and that it
would be as well to have the <i>burst</i> upon the great point of all.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 10th.</i>—Answer from the King. H.M. approves of what
his Ministry have said on the subject of the application to have
Catholic Sheriffs, but he, ‘Trusts the Parlt. would never under any
circumstances agree to the clause in the Mutiny Act. H.M.’s objections
do not result from any slight motive. They have never varied, for they
arise from principles by which he has been guided thro’ life, and to
which he is determined to adhere. He had hoped that the question would
never again have been agitated.’ (A copy from the original.)</p>

<p>In consequence of this answer from H.M. there was a meeting of the
Cabinet this eve. in which it was determined unanimously to persevere.
A respectful answer to H.M. was accordingly prepared, stating at full
length the reasons which induced the Cabinet to persist in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
opinion and determined them to bring the question before Parlt. It is
uncertain whether the K. will yield, dismiss them, or try to divide
them. Ld. Sidmouth and Ld. Ellenboro’ have behaved well, and even
stoutly. Erskine betrays great backwardness, tho’ he must go with
the rest. Whilst the letter for the K. was read, he affected to be
asleep, but Ld. Holland roused him and called his attention to this
<i>important</i> paper.</p>

<p>The King very cordial and civil to the Ministers at the Levée. In
his audience with Ld. Sidmouth he listened to the arguments for the
measure, and even dropped a sort of acquiescence. Erskine held a most
foolish, and even mischievous conversation with him. He told the K.
that had he been in the Irish Parlt., the measures for the Catholics
should not have passed without opposition: on which the K. complimented
him, and said, ‘I believe indeed, my Lord Chancellor, that you are
a good Protestant.’ ‘That, Sir, is my proudest title.’ The King is
certainly tractable, but told Ld. Sidmouth that he should take 24 hours
to consider of his answer to the Minute of the Cabinet. Ld. Grenville
accompanied the Cabinet Minute with a private letter of his own, which
pleased the K. mightily.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CATHOLIC QUESTION</div>

<p><i>Feb. 12th.</i>—King’s answer (exactly copied):—‘The King has
maturely considered what is stated in Ld. Grenville’s letter of the
10th inst., and the accompanying Minute of the Cabinet. He is disposed
upon this, as upon all occasions, to do full justice to the motives
which influence any advice which may be submitted to him by Ld.
Grenville and his other confidential servants; and however painful
His Majesty has found it to reconcile to his feelings the removal
of objections to any proposal which may have even the most distant
reference to a question which has already been subject of such frequent
and distressing reflections, he will not, under the circumstances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span> in
which it is so earnestly pressed, and adverting particularly to what
took place in 1791, prevent his Ministers from submitting for the
consideration of his Parlt. the propriety of inserting the proposed
clause in the Mutiny Bill. Whilst, however, the King so far reluctantly
concedes, he considers it necessary to declare that he cannot go one
step further, and he trusts that this proof of his forbearance will
secure him from being at a future period distressed by any further
proposal connected with the question. (Signed) G. R.’</p>

<p>Lds. H., Howick, and Hy. Petty had resolved upon going out, if the
Cabinet had not brought forward the clause in question, or if they had
afterwards given it up and without doing anything for the Catholics
opposed their petition in Parlt. But Ld. Howick declared (as however
he frequently does when in a passion) that he would retire from public
life.</p>

<p>A Cabinet last night upon the subject of Buenos Ayres and S. America;
there is much difference of opinion on these questions. Ld. Howick and
Mr. Grenville are averse to the diversion of any part of our force
to such distant objects, and think every part should be employed in
Europe. Ld. Grenville looks to conquest in S. America as useful to our
trade in war, and as objects of barter in making peace. He is therefore
against the adoption of any system which would prevent us from reducing
our conquests at the time of peace. Ld. H. objects to any attack upon
S. America, except for the purpose of revolutionising, but is very
desirous some such system should be adopted. Windham is eager for the
attack anyhow; tho’ he would prefer a systematic plan, yet he will
support any measure of that tendency. It was at length agreed that
two general officers should be sent out to take command of the difft.
bodies of troops re-united before Buenos Ayres, which make an effective
force of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span> 9000 men. General Whitelocke<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> is one, with discretionary
powers to fortify or defend Maldonado, to take or destroy Monte Video,
and to take Buenos Ayres or enter into terms with the inhabitants, as
they shall judge best for the King’s service; but to send back to Spain
all persons who took an active part against the English in the late
transactions. The desire of effacing our recent disgraces there had its
effect in determining this measure.</p>

<p><i>19th Feb.</i>—Went to Brighton to see my children, who are living
there for the sake of the good air, or rather to avoid the thick, bad
air of London and its neighbourhood. Mr. Allen only went with us. We
stayed Friday and Saturday; returned to town on Sunday.</p>

<p>The Norfolk Committee unseated Coke and Windham; Serjeant Lens made an
admirable speech.</p>

<p>Petty wrote to me that the Princess had determined to publish, and that
on my return I should find the ‘fire burning and cauldron bubbling’
with all the inflammable ingredients I knew of already.</p>

<p>Dined on Monday with Ld. Granville Leveson to meet Lady Stafford,<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>
whom I had not seen for many years except in a crowd. Seized at night
with a violent headache<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span> and cold, and some indications of fever.
Confined from that night until this day, the 2nd March, and not yet
recovered.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ABOLITION OF SLAVE TRADE</div>

<p><i>2nd March.</i>—The abolition of Slave Trade was carried in the H.
of C. by an immense majority, nearly 18 to 1; the opposition only 16.
Mr. Windham came to town to attend, but was prevented by a hoarseness;
wrote to Ld. Howick to notify he should oppose it in the Committee. Ld.
Castlereagh and Rose<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> absent. The Doctor’s men intended to oppose
some part in the Committee.</p>

<p>Catholics becoming more reasonable in Ireland. The Petition is to be
sent to Mr. Grattan instead of Ld. Howick, and it is to be brought
over by Lord Fingall<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> alone, and not by a Catholic Committee. This
will be advantageous to Ministers, as Ld. F. is open to various modes
of conciliation. Ld. Ponsonby’s<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> private letters to Ld. Howick
throw blame on the Irish Governt. He says, ‘His uncle George, the
Chancellor, is stark mad, and as rank an Orangeman as any in Ireland’:
that Elliot,<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> who knew of the Petition since July, has been
greatly to blame, and has by his cold manner repulsed the Catholics:
that Plunket,<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> the Attorney-General, is a secret enemy to the
Administration: that the Solicitor-General<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span> is not good for much,
and Curran is so bad in his office, where he has almost nothing to do,
that he ought to be removed. Secret abuses are every day discovered by
the investigating accountants, but are kept very secret, especially
the two following. Mr. Eden, since his succession to Ld. Thurlow’s
Tellership, it appears, has compelled his deputy, whose place is
1000<i>l.</i> pr. ann. and was always considered as one held for life,
under a threat of dismissal, to give him 400<i>l.</i> pr. ann. for his
brother. The deed was Ld. Auckland’s, so the poor fellow is sconced of
his 400<i>l.</i> pr. ann., a scandalous transaction, and one that the
honest will suffer by, as Ld. Howick swears the American Commission
shall not be paid as he originally designed, thus Mr. Allen will
suffer for his colleague’s dirtiness.<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> This proceeding will not be
revealed, as Ld. Buckingham was guilty of a similar action in favour of
Ld. Grenville’s family.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PUBLIC ACCOUNTS INQUIRY</div>

<p>T. S., one of Pitt’s oldest friends, and a man of a <i>studiously</i>
fair character, frank and honest to bluntness and a variety of other
such descriptive features peculiar to English worth, coarseness,
grossness, rudeness, and all leading to saying he was honest, turns
out to be <i>franchement</i> a rogue; having, it appears, appropriated
to his own private use balances of Governt. money to the amount of
9000<i>l.</i> He is now refunding principal and interest, imploring
secrecy. It is not however determined whether he is to be prosecuted;
but until it is decided, the business is kept secret and is not
revealed even to the Cabinet. These sturdy, plain characters often
prove to be the greatest thieves. These discoveries are owing, I
believe, to the Commissioners of Public Accounts. Mr. Biddulph’s
Committee of the H. of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span> Commons<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> has struck a general alarm into
sinecure placemen and peculators, as it is known to be composed of very
active, ardently zealous reformers. Ld. Ellenboro’, who has several
lucrative offices of that sort in his gift, complains of its taking
from the Chief Justice the only recompense for his services, which
consist in having the means to provide for his children, the salary not
being sufficiently great. The Commissioners have issued precepts for
inquiry into the Colonial Establishments, a measure not very acceptable
to Windham, and they are endeavouring to negotiate with the Bank to
manage the National Debt on more reasonable terms, from which they
expect to save from 60,000<i>l.</i> to 80,000<i>l.</i> pr. ann.</p>

<p>The affair of the Princess is drawing to a public disclosure of
the whole proceedings. The Prince has been advised by Romilly and
Garrow<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> to make application to the King that the charges against
the Princess may be tried in a Court of Common Law; and, on the
other hand, the Princess has been advised by her law counsellors to
publish her defence, which must lead, of course, to a publication of
the charges and evidence against her. It is said that her defence is
printing, and will be published on Wednesday.<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span></p>

<p>The Opposition are a disjointed, incoherent body, dissatisfied with
their situation, and with one another. Canning has made private
overtures to Ld. Grenville to be taken into office when an opportunity
presents itself, declaring himself greatly discontented with his
present associates. His demands are:—a high appointment for himself,
a place for Sturges, and a peerage for Sr. Hy. Mildmay. Ld. G. seems
not entirely disinclined to listen to such overtures. He is very
much out of humour with Whitbread for his speech on the first day of
the session, which, he scrupled not to say to Ld. Howick, betrayed
sentiments and views utterly inconsistent with those on which Ministers
had conducted the negotiation. But if Whitbread is set aside, and Ld.
Grey die, Petty would be left almost alone in the House of Commons, and
though his success there during the present session has been greater
than the most sanguine of his friends could have hoped for, still he
would require an able seconder, especially if Whitbread went eagerly
into Opposition. These considerations may weigh with Ld. G., and he may
also be desirous of having a speaker of the first rank in the House
of Commons, more connected with <i>himself</i>, and less attached to
the Whig party than Petty. Mr. Grenville is unwilling to be an every
day speaker in the House of Commons. C. Williams has no voice; Ld.
Temple is not listened to; but Canning, if brought into office now,
would attach himself to Ld. Grenville as he did to Pitt, and become
his peculiar organ in the H. of C. Ld. Wellesley has probably been the
channel of communication. Whitbread and Ld. Howick are far from being
cordial, and unfortunately the conduct of the former tends to widen
every day the breach between them, and his pretensions are so high,
that independent of the obstacles which he is himself creating, it
would be difficult for Ministry to satisfy him:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span> nothing will content
him, but to be considered as on a par with Lauderdale for pretensions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EXPEDITION TO CONSTANTINOPLE</div>

<p>There is every reason to fear that we shall be forced into war with
Turkey by the violence of Russia, though the Turks have made every
possible concession.<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> It is feared that we have already taken
possession of the Turkish fleet, and bombarded Constantinople.
Arbuthnot has orders to give the Turks the alternative of dismissing
Sebastiani, or having a war with England. Windham and T. Grenville
have, between them, given orders without the knowledge of their
colleagues, in the event of a war with Turkey, for 5000 men to be
taken from the army of Sicily, and employed in taking and garrisoning
Alexandria. Craufurd has been overtaken, and stopped from going to
Valparaiso.</p>

<p>Monroe has had a conversation with Ld. H. about Spanish America; he
wishes nothing to be attempted without a concert with the United
States, the country to be declared independent, and free ports to be
opened to both the invading powers. His accounts from Armstrong<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>
represent that there are great differences among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span> the French generals,
and that this alone has prevented Bonaparte’s return to Paris where his
presence was also required.</p>

<p><i>March 8th.</i>—The Princess has not published her defence, but
it is said she has got it printed at a private press belonging
to Perceval, and she threatens to publish it next Friday, if not
previously received at Court on Thursday. It is said that her
coarseness of language disgusts even her partisans.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CABINET CHANGES</div>

<p>The overtures of Canning are taken into consideration, and have been
the subject of conversation between Lds. Grenville, Howick, and
Holland. There is an idea that Lauderdale, Whitbread, and Canning may
be introduced into the Cabinet. Canning now requires Charles Long,<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>
Huskisson, and old G. Rose<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> to have places. Some of these and
Ld. Camden are only named <i>pro forma</i>, and would be sacrificed
if he could be taken in. How room can be made does not very readily
appear. When the Doctor was told of Canning’s proposals, he said,
that in the present stage of the business, he was not called upon to
interfere, but that if it was proposed to bring Canning into office,
his line was taken.<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> There is no reason whatever for any change
at present, except the alleged necessity of dismissing Windham on
account of his great mismanagement in his office and his conduct as
War Secretary, and the reduction of strength in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span> H. of Commons,
especially should Windham go with Opposition. But the real cause is
said to be Lord Grenville’s restlessness of disposition, which makes
him dissatisfied at the end of six months with every arrangement he
forms. Ld. H. is averse to these changes on the score of unfairness to
Addington, who must be made the sacrifice, especially as they conducted
themselves (<i>apparently</i>, a cautious saving always necessary,
however, for the Doctor’s conduct) well in the late discussions with
the King, and because he is naturally averse to the return of so many
of the Pitt-ites to power; and also that Canning’s introduction to
the Cabinet is the elevation of a rival to Petty. The latter opinion,
however, is more my own, and has inspired me with great distrust to
the proceedings. Petty, who at my earnest desire has been apprised of
the affair, as the injunction was that it was not to transpire, is, of
course, against it. Therefore if Ld. Howick (over whom Ld. Grenville
has acquired great influence) is of the same mind, there will be little
or no difficulty in counteracting it. Whitbread’s impatience for
office, and Ld. Howick’s extreme desire to have no political difference
with him, makes him lend a readier ear to such a plan than he would
otherwise do.</p>

<p>There is an expedition to be undertaken, which on acct. of Erskine’s
extraordinary imprudence in talking, is to be kept a secret from the
Cabinet, and only known to a few. Bad accounts from Drummond<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> of
the Court of Sicily; strong measures are to be resorted to without
delay to bring them to a more reasonable line of conduct. All Frenchmen
in the service of Sicily to be dismissed; none but Sicilians to be
employed in the service of the State; nominations of all officers in
the army to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span> left to the British Commander-in-Chief; grievances to
be redressed by the convocation of the Sicilian Parlt. If these terms
are not complied with, we are to declare we cannot defend the island,
and if refused, force employed to effectuate them. General Fox, Sr.
John Moore, and Drummond are to be associated in a joint Commission
for this important object.<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> Sr. Sidney Smith, who has been gained
over by the Queen and is completely subservient to her, is ordered on
a different service. The fury and violence of the Queen’s character
have not abated by age, and her <i>other</i> passions have as little
diminished. Ld. Ellenboro’ said, in the discussion of this business,
that our Sicilian Alliance seemed to him to cost £600,000 pr. ann., for
no other purpose than to maintain a —— house at Palermo.</p>

<p>Overtures for negotiations between France and Russia. Our Governt. have
expressed through Ld. Douglas<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> our readiness to become parties to a
negotiation for peace, and have expressed our wish that if a Congress
is to be held for that purpose, it should be appointed at Copenhagen;
but it has been distinctly explained to Russia, that the French
Colonies shall not be restored in return for the restitution of the
conquests made from Prussia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CATHOLIC QUESTION</div>

<p>There are hopes that the Irish Catholics may be induced to postpone
their Petition till another session. Ld. Ponsonby’s letters are
favourable to this expectation, and Mr. Butler has expressed the same
hopes to Ld. Holland.</p>

<p><i>14th March.</i>—Before it is decided whether Ministers are to go
out, or accommodate their present differences with the K., I shall try
and collect as well as I can, all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span> the important particulars which have
led things to the present vexatious state. It was the intention of Ld.
Grenville, not only to extend the provisions of the Irish Act of 1793
to the whole British Army, but also to open Staff appointments to the
Catholics, but this dispatch to the King was expressed with some degree
of ambiguity, so that it might be construed to mean that he intended
only to extend the provisions of the Irish Act to this country. It
was so understood by the King, Lds. Sidmouth, and Howick; and when
transmitted to Ireland and read by Mr. Elliot to the Catholics, it
appeared so ambiguous, that when they demanded an explanation of this
point, Mr. E. wrote to Ld. Spencer for instructions how to answer them.
This letter was sent to Lord Grenville, and answered by him without any
consultation with his colleagues. In his answer he expressed surprise
that Mr. Elliot should have had any difficulty upon the subject, and
authorised him to inform the Catholics that it was the intention of
Governt. to remove all disabilities whatever in the army attaching to
members of their Church.</p>

<p>When Ld. Sidmouth understood the misconception under which he had
laboured with regard to the meaning of the proposed clause, he appeared
to be extremely distressed, and expressed himself very doubtful
whether he should not enter into an explanation with the King, in
order to explain his own conduct in the whole affair. But at length he
determined that, if no communication was made on the subject by the
Cabinet, he should take no notice whatever of it; as it was uncertain
in what light the dispatch might have been viewed by the King, and
whether he had understood by it that the new clauses were to be exactly
the same as those of the Irish Act in 1793, or to apply also to the
Staff appointments. It was judged proper by the Cabinet to say nothing
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span> this difficulty and contrariety of opinions to the King, but to
send to him the proposed clauses, which it was found afterwards more
convenient to be made into a separate Bill, and to leave him to object
to them if they were different from what he was prepared for.</p>

<p>This having been done, and Ld. Howick having waited upon him on
Wednesday, 4th March, he remarked that the clauses went further than
the Irish Mutiny Bill, and when Ld. Howick explained to him how far
they were to be carried, he started, and exclaimed, ‘I’m sorry for
it, I can’t approve of it’; and in the course of their conversation
on the subject, in which Ld. Howick urged all the arguments for the
measure, he appeared not to be more reconciled, but as Ld. Howick
understood, he still gave his consent that the Bill in its present
form should be brought into Parlt. On coming out of the closet, Lord
Howick communicated his conversation to Ld. Grenville and Ld. Sidmouth,
the former of whom remarked, that since Lord Howick had had this
conversation with the King, he should not speak on the subject to His
Majesty, as he knew it to be so disagreeable to him. Ld. Sidmouth, it
appears, did hold some conversation on the subject to the King, in
which he repeated Ld. Howick’s conversation in a sense which induced
the K. to believe that the additional clauses would not be brought
into Parliament till some further communications were held with him.
Ld. Howick, having a different impression of his conversation, brought
the proposed Bill into the House, which was read the first time, and
ordered to be printed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CATHOLIC QUESTION</div>

<p>On Monday, the 9th, or Tuesday, the 10th, Ld. Grenville received a
mysterious letter from Ld. Sidmouth regretting that he must differ
from his colleagues on so important a point as the Catholic Bill, and
requesting to have a conversation with him on the subject. From this
conversation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span> it appeared that he was determined to oppose the Bill in
the House of Lords, and that his friends should take the same line in
the H. of Commons. As it appeared from this and other circumstances
that the King and his friends were resolved to oppose the Bill, it
became a question what course it was proper for Ministers to pursue.
It was proposed by some to bring the Bill through the Commons, so as
to pledge that House on the subject, and if any placemen voted against
it, to turn them out instantly, or propose doing so to the King; and if
this measure should not be assented to by him, not to insist upon it
immediately, nor yet quite give it up, but bring the Bill into the H.
of Lords, and on its rejection in that House, to resign, and commence
an active and vigorous Opposition. But to this course of proceeding
it was objected by Ld. Grenville that it would lead to a protracted
contest between the King and the Ministry, which, in the present state
of affairs, could not but be prejudicial to the country; and the
question was therefore proposed whether they should resign, or yield
the question in dispute.</p>

<p>This was argued at his house on Wednesday, 11th, in the evening, at
a meeting consisting of Ld. Grenville, Mr. Grenville, Lds. Howick,
Holland, Henry Petty. Both the Grenvilles said they were ready to go
out if their colleagues thought they could not retreat with honour,
but they showed themselves very unwilling to that measure. Petty said
the same, with the same reluctant offer. The great argument for not
breaking with the King on this point was that this case would appear
a bad one to the public, as it might be plausibly argued that they
had deceived the King and committed his Governt. to more than he had
authorised them to grant. Lds. Howick and Holland, who were the most
averse to concession, were induced at length to give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span> up, seeing that
their colleagues, though they offered to resign upon this point, did it
reluctantly and with a grudge; and being also satisfied that the whole
transaction with the King might be represented in the light that was
argued by the others.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CATHOLIC QUESTION</div>

<p>On Thursday, the 12th, Ld. Howick had an audience of the King, in which
the K. behaved to him in the most civil manner, paid him compliments to
himself and family, lamented that Ld. Howick had so far misunderstood
him in their last conversation, as to imagine that he had his consent
to propose the Bill to Parlt., but declared himself satisfied that
this was a mere misapprehension on his own side, in consequence of his
understanding the reverse to be Ld. Howick’s idea of the conversation
from Ld. Sidmouth soon after he parted from Ld. Howick. He assured
Ld. Howick that he had spoken of the affair to no persons out of the
Cabinet, except to persons of his own family; that he had taken no
measures to form an Administration, and that if he must separate from
his present advisers, he trusted that, as he had behaved and should
behave honourably to them, they would not retire from his service till
he had made arrangements to supply their place. He expressed himself in
the most flattering manner to Ld. Howick personally, and remarked that
he had not been aware till lately of his sentiments on the Catholic
question. It seems, when Ld. Sidmouth told him the week before what
were Ld. Howick’s opinions on that subject, he started with evident
surprise, from which it was argued some days ago that in the end he
would yield. Ld. Howick endeavoured to extract from him what was the
most he would concede in the present question to the Catholics, but
found him resolved not to go beyond the Irish Act of 1793. When Ld.
Howick mentioned the extending the same to the Navy, he started and
expressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span> disapprobation. When Ld. Howick said, if the clauses were
extended to the Catholics in England, they must also be extended to the
Protestant Dissenters (who were not included in the Irish Act, because
the Test Act was abolished in Ireland in 1774 or 1775), he started
again, and exclaimed, ‘But this is attacking the Establishment.’ In a
word, he consents to the extension of the Act of ’93 to England, but to
nothing more.</p>

<p>Rumours are afloat of the resignation of the Doctor, of the whole
Ministry going out, of the Catholic Bill being abandoned, etc.; and
Canning—the worthless Canning!—who was eight days ago actually in
<i>terms</i> with Ld. Grenville, actually treating with Ld. Grenville
and holding with him a private correspondence for the purpose of
being taken into office, is now thick with Perceval, and ready, they
say, to oppose any Bill brought forward to relieve the Catholics.
The behaviour of the Doctor is still problematical. Ld. Grenville is
greatly exasperated with him, but Ld. Holland, with more indulgence
than justice, is disposed to view his conduct more favourably, and to
believe that his misconception of the measure was real, and his sorrow
unfeigned when he discovered what was intended to be done. But Ld.
Sidmouth certainly misrepresented Ld. Howick’s conversation with him to
the King, and it is now said that he has been intriguing for the last
ten days with Perceval. The D. of Cumberland was very busy in the H.
of Lords communicating to his friends the joyful news of a change of
Ministry.</p>

<p>The clauses were sent to Windsor on Tuesday, March 3rd, and returned by
the King the same evening, without any animadversion or objection; on
which they were instantly despatched by a messenger to Ireland. Very
suspicious against the veracity of H.M.</p>

<p><i>15th March.</i>—(On Friday, the 13th, Ld. Sidmouth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span> did offer to
resign, but it was not accepted by Ld. Grenville.)</p>

<p>There was a Cabinet to-day at which neither Ld. Ellenboro’ or Sidmouth
assisted. It was then determined to withdraw the Bill which had given
His Majesty so much uneasiness, but to reserve to the members of the
Cabinet as individuals to express their opinion on the Catholic claims
if brought before Parlt. by the Catholics, which measure, however, the
members of the Cabinet pledged themselves not to encourage or recommend
the Catholics to adopt.</p>

<p>The reasons for giving up the Bill were as follows:—</p>

<p>1st. The K. considered himself as pledged to no more than ye Irish Act
of ’93, and was determined to resist any further concession to the
Catholics. But the mere extension of the Irish Act of 1793 would not
tend in any degree to satisfy the C., nor to allay their discontent,
while it would be unjust and unfair to the English Dissenters, whom it
would place on a worse footing than the Irish Catholics.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CATHOLIC QUESTION</div>

<p>2nd. But if the Bill, modified and reduced as it is by the King, would
be useless and objectionable, the prosecution of the original Bill
could not be persisted in, without incurring the reproach of having
taken advantage of the King; of having deceived him into acquiescence
with a measure not properly explained to him; and when the mistake was
cleared up, of having made use of the opportunity to commit the House
of Commons on a measure so decidedly contrary to his opinion. If the
Bill was dropped on acct. of those last considerations, the Ministry
must either resign, or go on with the disadvantage of having abandoned
a measure of so much importance, and of having been baffled by the K.
and a most contemptible colleague. In their voluntary resignation there
were many objections. It would preclude them from employing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span> their
present strength in the H. of Commons in addressing the King against
the change of his confidential advisers, because whatever might be
the cause of their resignation, the act, if voluntary, necessarily
compelled the King to look for other advisers; and till those advisers
were tried, it would appear factious to move addresses against them.
Besides this reason for not resigning, the question of the C. was not
popular in the kingdom, and a cry could be easily raised against it and
its friends. It was therefore resolved to go on for the present, but as
the King had now discovered his strength, and as little confidence or
cordiality could longer exist between him and his present Ministers, it
was determined to take the first popular ground of difference, and to
resign upon it; and to take off the impression of having been baffled
by Ld. Sidmouth, it was determined that he should be instantly turned
out. Besides these reasons for the line taken upon this occasion by the
Cabinet, there were several who persistently indulged the hope that the
King would not be satisfied with this concession, but that he would
demand some further pledge on which they might make a stand on better
ground than they occupied at present. The event proved their sagacity.</p>

<p><i>16th March</i>.—On Monday, 16th, Ld. Grenville went down to Windsor
with the Minute which had been agreed to on the day before in the
Cabinet. The K. required 24 hours to consider of his answer, and on
Tuesday morning he sent the following to Ld. Grenville:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="r2">17th March, Windsor Castle.</p>

<p>‘The King having fully considered what is submitted in the
Minute of Cabinet which he received yesterday morning,
desires Ld. G. will communicate to those who were present
his sentiments and observations upon the contents of that
Minute as hereafter explained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span></p>

<p>‘His Majesty has learned with satisfaction that they have
determined not to press forward any further the discussion
of the Bill depending in Parlt., and he is sensible of the
deference shown to his sentiments and feelings, but he
regrets that while they have felt bound as his Ministers
to adopt this line of conduct, they should as individuals
consider it necessary to submit to Parlt. opinions which
are known to be so decidedly contrary to his principles, at
a moment too when it is the declared object of his Governt.
not to encourage any disposition on the part of the R.
Catholics of Ireland to prefer a Petition to Parliament.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CATHOLIC QUESTION</div>

<p>‘From the latter part of the Minute the K. must conclude,
that altho’ the Bill which was depending is dropped, they
have been unable to make up their minds not to press upon
him in future measures connected with a question which
has already proved so distressing to him, nor can H.M.
conceal from them that this intimation on their part,
unless withdrawn, will leave the matter in a state most
embarrassing and unsatisfactory to him, and in his opinion
not less to them. The K. therefore considers it due to
himself and consistent with fair and upright conduct, which
it has and ever will be his object to observe towards
everyone, to declare at once most unequivocally that upon
this subject his sentiments never can change, that he
cannot ever agree to any concession which his confidential
servants may in future propose to him; and that under these
circumstances and after what has passed, his mind cannot be
at ease unless he shall receive a positive assurance from
them which shall effectually relieve him from all future
apprehension.</p>

<p class="r2">‘(Signed) <span class="smcap">George R.</span>’</p>
</div>

<p>The preceding note was enclosed in the following:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="r2">March 17th, 1807.</p>

<p>‘The King has lost no time in dictating the answer to the
Minute of Cabinet. Ld. Grenville will receive it enclosed,
and H.M. desires he will communicate it to his colleagues,
trusting at the same time that Ld. Grenville will see the
propriety, with a view to the prevention of all future
mistakes, that when they shall have duly considered the
latter part of His Majesty’s answer, their determination
should be stated on paper.</p>

<p class="r2">‘(Signed) <span class="smcap">George R.</span>’</p>
</div>

<p>When these notes were received by Ld. Grenville the Ministry were
in a very embarrassing situation, in consequence of having received
the night before Ld. Spencer’s resignation, which he sent to Ld.
Grenville the instant he was informed that the Bill in Parlt. was to
be abandoned, thinking himself particularly pledged to it, as being
the person through whom it had been communicated to the Irish Governt.
and to the Catholics that such a Bill was determined upon. The King’s
notes were therefore received with the greatest satisfaction, as
it enabled the whole of the Ministry, Ld. Sidmouth and his friends
excepted, to retire from office upon good and constitutional grounds,
while their offer to abandon the Bill exempted them from any charge of
having deceived or attempted to overreach the K. A respectful but firm
answer was therefore sent, refusing to give the pledge for their future
conduct which the King demanded.</p>

<p><i>18th.</i>—The answer of the Cabinet was given to the King this
morning. He is to take, as before, 24 hours to think of his reply.</p>

<p>He was to-day (Wednesday) very civil to Ld. Howick, hoped that if they
did part, they should part with a more favourable impression of each
other than they had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span> entertained before they met. Assured him that he
had consulted with no one, not even with his own family, about forming
a new Administration.</p>

<p>The Prince takes part with his father on this the present question, and
he is full of complaints against Ministers for their conduct to him in
his difference with the Princess. Lady Hertford has great influence
with him at present, and she employs it. It is not many weeks since
that he offered to write a letter to Ld. Howick for the purpose of its
being shown to the Catholics, in which he would have pledged himself
to the Catholics, provided they remained quiet at present. Ld. Holland
did not encourage this measure, because as he had once broken his word
to the Catholics, it was supposed that a promise from him would have
little or no effect upon them. Ld. Moira is also extremely dissatisfied
with the greater part of his colleagues; he told Ld. H. two nights
ago that if this rupture had not taken place, he would have resigned
shortly, and that when they went out he should resign his Staff
appointments, and consider himself as no longer connected in party with
his present colleagues. He complained that since Mr. Fox’s illness no
one, except Ld. Holland, had treated him confidentially.<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A NEW ADMINISTRATION</div>

<p>Ld. H. this morning, through Ld. Granville Leveson, proposed a Cabinet
place <i>immediately</i> to Canning if they should remain in office, or
return to it after a victory over the Court. Ld. G. Leveson received
the overtures thus made rather coldly. He seemed to think that Canning
would take the opposite side to Ld. Sidmouth, and in the evening he
seemed disturbed by a speech of Bragge’s,<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span> who had said when
asked what part Ld. Sidmouth’s friends meant to take in the present
differences, ‘Why, stick by the King, to be sure.’ It is not known that
any person has as yet been sent for by the K. to consult with about a
new Administration.</p>

<p><i>19th.</i>—Letters from the D. of Bedford and Ld. Ponsonby. It
seems that the Catholics had been induced by the exertions of Ld.
Ponsonby and representations from the Castle, aided by the proof given
by Ministers of their unabated zeal in their cause by the clauses in
the Mutiny Bill, to abandon the intention of petitioning Parliament
this session. But when these letters were written, rumours had arrived
of the difficulties in carrying through the Mutiny Bill, and that
Ministers were suspected of an intention to give way upon that point.</p>

<p>Early to-day Lds. Eldon and Hawkesbury went to Windsor in consequence
of a message from the King communicated to them by ye D. of Cumberland.
In the course of the morning they called upon ye D. of Portland, with
the King’s commands to form a new Administration and to consult on that
subject with two of Mr. Pitt’s friends. Reports of the D. of Portland
declining to act on acct. of his infirmities; others again that he
declined acting if Ld. Melville was to be one of the Ministers, or if
it was resolved to dissolve Parlt. Ld. C. Spencer came from Burlington
House and reported them as being greatly alarmed. Ld. Hardwicke<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>
called in the evening at Ld. Grenville’s, and having inquired into the
truth of the pledge said to have been demanded by the King from his
Ministers, Ld. G. showed him the King’s note, on which Ld. Hardwicke
expressed himself perfectly satisfied with the conduct of Ministers
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span> thought they could not have acted otherwise with honour, and
that those who had advised the King to demand such a pledge were
impeachable. He concluded by assuring Ld. Grenville of his support and
of that of his brother, Mr. Yorke.<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> Wilberforce also called on Ld.
Grenville, and expressed much concern for what had happened, as well as
approbation of the conduct of Ministers.</p>

<p>It is said that with a view to shake the power of Ministers in order to
get rid of Windham, whom he detests, the D. of York had originally some
share in awakening his father’s scruples in the Catholic Bill. It is
also said that he now heartily repents of what he has done, and would
willingly assist to resettle matters. He justly fears a Ministry formed
of the friends of the Pss. of Wales. Both he and the Prince, who has,
but more strongly, the same fears, have offered to go down to Windsor
to endeavour to accommodate matters. The D. of Cumberland has availed
himself of the King’s insanity upon the C. Question to effect this
change. He read to him Perceval’s speech agst. the Catholics as the
sentiments of all good Protestants upon the subject, by which the K.
was exceedingly agitated, as he always is when the subject is discussed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHANGE OF MINISTRY</div>

<p>When the King returned to Windsor on Wednesday,<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> he was exceedingly
agitated, and after retiring for a short time alone, he desired
that Col. Taylor might be sent for immediately, and upon his coming
he dictated letters to Lds. Eldon and Hawkesbury. When Ld. Howick
arrived on Thursday evening, the King told him that it was but fair to
acknowledge that he parted with his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span> present Ministers with regret,
that he had hesitated long before he resolved upon it, that it was
not till after re-perusing their communication and consulting with
his family that he had determined upon it. That he had never had the
slightest difference with them till now, and that it was only to get
rid of a sword constantly suspended over his head that he now resolved
to dismiss them from his service. All this was studiously told by the
King’s friends, and of course the sentiments are entitled to little or
no credit.</p>

<p><i>20th.</i>—The D. of Portland has consented to waive this objection
founded on the bad state of his health, provided any arrangement can
be devised which promises to last. They find great difficulties in
forming their arrangements. Mr. Yorke has said to Chas. Long that he
would take no part in their Administration, and that he disapproved of
their intention of forming one. Tierney reckons 220 Members in the H.
of Commons steady to the <i>late Ministers</i>, without including Ld.
Wellesley’s members, Ld. Carrington’s, Mr. Eden, the Saints, or the
Doctor’s.</p>

<p><i>21st.</i>—Ld. Hardwicke set off this morning to Windsor, and on his
return went to Burlington House.</p>

<p>Lds. Grenville, Howick, and Holland had a very long conference. Ld.
Grenville, averse to active measures; afraid ‘lest the tail should get
the better of the head.’ Ld. Howick is to write to the King, urging the
necessity of being prepared to explain the situation of Ministry in the
H. of C., if called upon on Monday.</p>

<p>Letters from Ireland yesterday and to-day. It appears that if they had
given up the Bill and remained in office, the D. of Bedford, Elliot,
(and <i>probably</i>) the Chancellor Ponsonby, would have resigned;
and Ld. Ponsonby, who has great influence over the Catholics, would
have been incensed and gone into Opposition.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span> Charles Long told Ld.
Lauderdale that he had called upon him twice three days ago, to have
talked over the state of affairs, but it was now too late. Canning told
Ld. Holland that he doubted whether Ld. H. regretted more this break up
than <i>he</i> did!!! Ld. Spencer told the King on Wednesday last his
determination to resign if the Bill was abandoned.</p>

<p>Windham, in a sudden fit of disgust, told Ld. Grenville that he desired
he might no longer be considered as connected with <i>him</i>, as he
meant to attach himself to Lds. Howick and Holland solely. This rash
declaration was ill-timed, and nothing could be more ill-judged than
to do this at a moment when unanimity is so requisite, and when all
jealousies should be laid aside.</p>

<p>The event most to be feared at present is that the King should consent
to withdraw the <i>pledge</i> he demands of them; and to accept
their offer to give up the Bill with the general reservation which
accompanied that offer. This would change the public ground on which
they stand, and very probably disunite them.</p>

<p><i>22nd.</i>—The Archbishop of Canterbury<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> is expressing
everywhere the most rapturous joy at what has taken place. He says,
‘It is the <i>neatest</i> done thing possible. Ministers have given
up enough to forfeit the confidence of the Catholics, and will not
therefore have the consolation of dying martyrs in the cause.’ ‘They
have drawn their own teeth and cannot bite.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHANGE OF MINISTRY</div>

<p>Ld. Hardwicke dined yesterday with Ld. Grenville. His visit yesterday
to Windsor was not in consequence of any message from the King, but
originating from himself in order to express to His Majesty his opinion
of the proposed alteration in his Governt. He arrived at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span> Windsor
about the same time as Ld. Eldon, and as the K. was gone out, both had
some time to wait before they had an audience. The K. answered Ld.
Hardwicke’s arguments by saying it was a matter of conscience, and in
urging Ld. Hardwicke to take office he expressed great personal esteem
for him, and added, ‘I know the Yorkes are not given to cabals.’ Ld.
Westmoreland says this visit might have done some days ago, and served
the Ministry, but that now it is too late. The report in town was that
he was sent down by Ld. Grenville to accommodate matters.</p>

<p>Ld. Aberdeen says Ld. Melville is too infirm to accept offices; others
that he expects to be high in the Administration. Ld. Auckland has
written a very good letter to the King;<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> the worst, however, is
that he did this upon a former change, and his resignation is not that
of any office of emolument. His pension absorbs the salary of any place
he holds.</p>

<p><i>23rd.</i>—King’s answer to Ld. Howick gives him permission to state
to the House that he is employed in forming a new Administration.
Dickenson, the member for Somersetshire, is to put a question to Ld.
Howick this evening in order to lead to the explanation.</p>

<p>Dickenson did the business very ill, and so clumsily that he did no
good by his query. His questions were whether Ministers were still in
office, and whether the reports were true that they had attempted to
surprise the King’s conscience? Ld. Howick answered the 1st question,
but declined making any reply to the 2nd. A great attendance in the
House, but usual coldness manifested to a falling Ministry. Great
diversity of opinion as to the mode of conducting the Opposition. Ld.
Grenville, of course, hampered in consequence of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span> the part he took in
1784. All resigned on March the 25th. The Prince acted shabbily; what
he called neutral.</p>

<p>The loss of all interest in public affairs was the natural effect of
the change of Administration to me. The Dissolution took place in May.
The elections turned out full as favourable as had been expected.
Bedfordshire was closely run between Fitzpatrick and Osborne, and
carried by a moderate majority. Yorkshire very triumphant in favour of
Ld. Milton;<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> Wilberforce accused and suspected of coalescing with
Lascelles, lost him greatly his popularity, and his shabby desertion
of the late Ministry.<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> A petition against Milton was ready, and
upon the point of being presented, but he judiciously procured one also
against Wilberforce, which, being held <i>in terrorem</i>, inclined
Wilberforce to exert and pledge himself on behalf of Ministers, who
came forward and promised to drop the petition against Ld. Milton, if
he in return would stipulate that the one against Wilberforce should be
dropped.</p>

<p>On ye 1st of May we went with all our family, excepting Mary,<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> to
Southampton. We lived in the Margravine’s house on the margin of the
water. The weather was remarkably fine, the scenery agreeable, and the
singularity of the arrangement of the houses and a terrace give it a
foreign air, which transported me in imagination to happier localities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">SOUTHAMPTON</div>

<p>The Cowpers<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> made us a visit of a week; the Kinnairds took a house
near to us and spent a fortnight. Lauderdale, Marsh, B. Frere, and Mr.
Horner made us a visit for a few days. We went over to Portsmouth to
take leave of Bartholomew, who was going with Sr. Arthur Paget<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a>
to Constantinople. He brought with him Mr. Morier,<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> a sensible,
agreeable young man, who went in the capacity of interpreter; he is a
nephew of Ly. Radstock’s, his mother being a Smyrnese. Made several
excursions to Broadlands, the New Forest, and Titchfield Castle,
&amp;c. The latter is remarkable for having been the birthplace of the
celebrated Ly. Russell; the last place in England where Charles I. took
refuge. It is in a ruinous state, but even in its decay retains strong
marks of its former splendour; the stables are spacious and grand.</p>

<p>Returned home about 17th June, 1807. Parliament very briskly attended;
scandalous retaliation of each party upon the score of jobbing.
Unfortunate Scotch business of Adam about Ld. Cullen.<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>

<p>Ld. Granville Leveson set off upon his Embassy to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span> Petersburg. An
expedition fitted out to the Baltic. Treaty of Tilsit arrived.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>After the delay of a fortnight, in consequence of my having a smart
bilious fever, we set off on the 22nd of August for our Scotch tour.
Our party consisted of ourselves, Charles, Mr. Allen, Marsh, Mr. Knapp,
Amelie, Aleck, Baptiste, Wm., Antonio. Being rather weak, the journeys
were to be short. The first night we slept at Dunstable. On Sunday went
through Northampton to Welford. The road remarkably good and handsome,
raised upon a <i>chaussée</i>, like the public roads in France, Italy,
or Spain.</p>

<p>On Monday passed through Leicester and Loughboro’ to Nottingham, where
we dined. It is a considerable town, well situated; the site of the
ancient castle is very striking, tho’ it is greatly destroyed by the
modern mansion which the bad taste of a Duke of Newcastle allowed to
be erected within the old walls.<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> The Trent is rather a large
river; the bridge we crossed was handsome and well built. Ld. H. called
upon the Mayor and Recorder; the Corporation are chiefly Dissenters,
and strongly attached to the Opposition. They testified their respect
for the memory of Mr. Fox by sending a deputation from the town of
Nottingham to walk at his funeral. In the evening we were overtaken by
a storm of thunder and lightning just upon the outskirts of Sherwood
Forest; I was terrified, and sought shelter in the house of a family of
the name of <i>Lowe</i>. We proceeded on to Mansfield, where we slept.
On Tuesday we set off at eleven, went about two miles out of the direct
road to see Hardwicke, the prison for many years of the unfortunate
Mary. The house in which she was confined is falling into ruins;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
the present house was built by the celebrated Elizabeth, Countess of
Shrewsbury, after Mary had been withdrawn from her custody.</p>

<p>The road to Chesterfield is pretty. Sheffield was full as dirty and
offensive as before. Slept at Penistone, a small village and bad
inn quite out of the high road. Got out and looked at the Castle of
Skipton, a valuable estate annexed to which belongs to Thanet. Got late
in the evening to Lowood Inn, by the side of Windermere. I was not well
in the night.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WORDSWORTH</div>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>—Sent an invitation to Wordsworth, one of the Lake
poets, to come and dine, or visit us in the evening. He came. He is
much superior to his writings, and his conversation is even beyond
his abilities. I should almost fear he is disposed to apply his
talents more towards making himself a <i>vigorous conversationist</i>
in the style of our friend Sharp,<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> than to improve his style of
composition. He is preparing a manual to guide travellers in their tour
amongst the Lakes. He holds some opinions on picturesque subjects with
which I completely differ, especially as to the effects produced by
<i>white</i> houses on the sides of the hills; to my taste they produce
a cheerful effect. He, on the contrary, would brown, or even black-work
them; he maintained his opinion with a considerable degree of
ingenuity. His objection was chiefly grounded upon the distances being
confounded by the glare of white. He seems well read in his provincial
history.</p>

<p>On Thursday, after stopping to see a very feeble cascade at Sr. Daniel
Le Fleming’s, we reached Keswick to dinner. We found Southey, who had
accepted our invitation. He is full of genius and poetical enthusiasm.
His <i>History of Portugal</i> is suspended in order that he may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
publish, by way of prefatory discourse, a <i>Life of the Cid</i>, which
he is translating from an old Chronicle, and unfortunately into the
style and language of the Bible. He has already made that experiment
in his translation of <i>Amadis de Gaul</i>, and of his <i>History of
Portugal</i>; to suit the curiosity of the day, he is going to publish
the colonial part first.<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> This may be profitable, and the spirit of
it obtained him from Whishaw the name of ‘Voulgar Tradesman.’ In the
evening we visited his family; I was curious to see his interior. His
house is excellent and beautifully situated. He seems much beloved by a
numerous domestic circle of connections and friends; he is surrounded
by heaps of old and valuable Spanish books.</p>

<p>On Friday we set off to profit by the hospitality of Ld. Thanet, who
offered us the comfort and repose of Appleby. We passed by Ullswater,
but only saw the upper part of the Lake, which, from all accounts, is
very inferior in beauty to the view a few miles lower. From Pooley
Bridge we drove through a very fine country to Appleby. On our road we
got out to see Brougham Hall, a very beautiful place belonging to Mr.
Brougham’s father. The view from the terrace is quite magnificent; the
family have not inhabited the house for many years, and it is falling
fast into decay.</p>

<div class="sidenote">APPLEBY CASTLE</div>

<p>Appleby is placed in a commanding situation above the town; a pretty
torrent rushes beneath the walls. The old Keep or Citadel was, till
within these few years, used as the prison. Ld. Thanet is Hereditary
Sheriff of the County. The present mansion is built out of the
old Castle, or rather made within its walls. This was done by the
celebrated Ann Clifford, the heiress and representative of the Earls
of Cumberland; her daughter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span> married a Tufton, and thus brought these
immense northern estates into the present family. She wrote the famous
letter, in reply to the solicitation of a Minister of Charles II. or
James, to allow a Court member to stand for Appleby, ‘I have been
threatened by a usurper, neglected by a Court, but will not be bullied
by a subject; your man shall <i>not</i> stand.’</p>

<p>Mr. Wyburgh, a lawyer of eminence, was in the Castle; he was employed
on an election arbitration between Ld. Lowther and Thanet, upon the
number of votes in Appleby.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Visiting Naworth Castle, where ‘Lord Carlisle occasionally
comes for a fortnight in the shooting season,’ the party
entered Scotland, and passing Longtown, Moffat, and Lanark,
reached Hamilton. ‘The Palace is reckoned gloomy. The
present Duke has augmented the collection of pictures, but
the Rubens and Vandyke still maintain their posts as the
first....’</p>
</div>

<p><i>8th.</i>—Got to Dumbarton. Slept at Aroquhar; a good inn, well
situated upon a salt loch; it was very beautiful, but we could not
admire it after having spent the day by the side of Loch Lomond, so
in a storm of hail, rain, wind, and sleet, and snow falling upon the
mountains, we reached Inverary. The Duke<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> is in perfect health;
the inmates there, the Bedfords, Ld. John<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> and Mr. Hunt, the T.
Sheridans, E. Bligh, Lewis, Chester, Cornewall, H. Scott. At difft.
times, Ld. Ely, Downshire, Messrs. Reid, Ld. John Campbell, Mr.
Campbell, Col. Callander, McDonald, and Clanronald, and others whom I
have forgotten. The house has undergone great alterations; the upper
floor is entirely new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span> furnished. To enliven the scene the high road
is brought close to the windows. Upon the whole it is a most princely
domain, and the Duke is a noble Chieftain. The only objection to the
mode of life is the extraordinary lateness of the hours, and the
consequent inability of doing anything; some wags have called it the
Castle of Indolence. As late as half past seven in the morning, I have
heard the billiards at work by T. Sheridan and Mr. Chester.<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p>

<p>After a tour along Loch Tay to Blair Atholl, they turned
south to Perth, visited Brechin Castle and Dundee, and
reached Edinburgh on October 6.</p>
</div>

<p>During our stay there we saw much of Messrs. Playfair, Jeffrey,
Brougham, Murray, Dr. Cameron the Catholic Bishop (late Principal of
the Scotch College at Valladolid), a very able man, Thompsons, &amp;c., &amp;c.
Lauderdale came over to see us; the Bedfords for a short time.</p>

<p>Slept three nights at Dunbar House, and went from thence to Howick,
staying several days. Through York to Castle Howard; stayed three
nights. Marsh remained there; and by the way of Newark to Nottingham,
where Ld. H. received the Freedom of ye City, and we went by Leicester
to meet, at Hinckley, Henry E.,<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> whom Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span> Fox brought us from
St. Anne’s. We there consulted with Chesher, a famous mechanician for
instruments; he measured the limb, and gave us hopes that he could
contrive an instrument to assist his walking. From Hinckley we went
through Litchfield to Trentham Hall, where we stayed a few days;
returned through Hinckley to Woburn Abbey. We there spent upwards of a
week most agreeably. Returned home, Nov. 24th, 1807.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HENRY EDWARD FOX</div>

<p><i>Dec. 12th.</i>—Mr. Allen accompanied Henry E. to Hinckley, where he
was to reside with Ld. Robt. Fitzgerald, and under his protection.</p>

<p>On 31st Dec. went without Mr. Allen, who was employed busily at home,
for a few days to Brocket. We there heard of the measles having
appeared in Ld. Robt.’s family, and set off to Hinckley to remove Henry
E., if possible, in time. We slept at Woburn one night on our way in
going, two at Ampthill, and one more at Woburn on our return. Henry E.
did not escape the measles, but is now recovering.</p>

<p><i>January 1808, H. House.</i>—Sr. Arthur Paget returned last month
from his unsuccessful Embassy. For seven months he only slept one night
on land. He never approached nearer the Porte than the small Island of
Imbros. B. Frere returned with him. He sent Mr. Morier to Egypt.</p>

<p>The choice of G. Ponsonby for a Leader to the Opposition has been more
approved, or, rather, to speak more correctly, less objected to than
might have been expected.<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> The public laugh at the having sent to
Ireland for a leader; Fox’s friends are indifferent since his death.
Petty is reasonable as usual, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span> Whitbread, goaded by a scribbling
gazetteer of the name of Belsham,<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> submits with a thousand
reservations each more hostile than the other. Tom Grenville absolutely
declined, on the score of health alone; he is in fact far from a
robust subject, and quite unfit to undergo the fatigues of a long
debate. Sheridan’s talents would entitle him to the first rank, but his
profligacy of character, both as to veracity and honesty, besides his
habitual debauchery, place him entirely <i>hors de combat</i>.</p>

<p>Ld. Granville Leveson is just returned from Petersburg; another
fruitless Mission! He describes the Emperor as being totally subjugated
by Bonaparte, and even trembling before his representative, General
Savary, who assumes the air of a master in Russia.<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> From the little
I have heard, he seems to me to be entirely belonging to the present
Governt.</p>

<p>On Monday, the 17th, we took Charles to Eton. He is now launched into
the sea of human affairs; the <i>world</i> of a public school he will
find very different from that of the world seen from under the paternal
roof.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WAR BY COMPULSION</div>

<p>On ye 16th, the chief persons of ye Opposition dined at Ld.
Grenville’s; Whitbread was not originally invited, but was so, at the
particular request of Ld. Grey. Stahremberg<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> sent the whole of the
correspondence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span> between him and the Governt. which ended in the present
rupture between them and his Court. Mr. Canning seems to have rejected
the mediation of Austria in very unbecoming terms, and in his usual
flippant manner; the whole will be made public. S.’s instructions are
peremptory as to his quitting England before the meeting of Parlt.
Bonaparte offered passports for <i>two</i> plenipos., hoped they
would select men of ‘<i>formes simples</i>’ and of a ‘<i>caractère
impassible</i>’; a glance against either Lds. Lauderdale or Malmesbury.
S., in his private letters to Metternich, complained of Mr. Canning’s
impetuosity, and misapprehension of several expressions. Whitbread,
with malignity and in the most unprovoked manner, attacked Ld. Grey at
dinner; all were disgusted at his rancorous spirit. It was unfortunate
that such a wrangle should occur before Ld. Grenville upon the subject
of peace, as he had only just been persuaded against seceding himself
from the H. of Lords upon the precise subject of the question of peace,
and the want of discipline and unanimity amongst the difft. parts of
the Opposition.</p>

<p><i>18th.</i>—Ld. H. dined at Ld. Stafford’s. We went to the Birthday.</p>

<p><i>19th.</i>—The same party dined here as did at Ld. Grenville’s, with
the addition of a few, and Ld. Erskine, <i>nommément</i> to prevent a
recurrence of the unpleasant conversation between Whitbread and Grey.</p>

<p>I hear nothing but of Coleridge, which makes me regret not being
acquainted with him. After having accepted, by way of recompense
for three scurrilous letters against Mr. Fox which appeared in the
<i>Morning Post</i> upon his residence at Paris, a Commissaryship
at Malta, he is returned to England, where he is supposed to employ
himself in writing articles in the <i>Courier</i>.<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> His nature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span> is
radically bad; he hates and envies all that are good and celebrated,
and to gratify that spleen he has given in to Methodism, not from
conviction, but solely to enable him to give vent to his malignity
in a garb which is a <i>passe partout</i>. He is fond of maintaining
paradoxes; at a dinner lately he began by attacking Sir Isaac Newton’s
philosophy, Bonaparte’s military talents, and Virgil as a poet. He
is often obscure, a mystical species of platonic philosophy, which
he dresses up according to his own metaphysical taste, and calls the
<i>mind</i>. A new theory he descants upon at length, and in his
exposition of it absorbs the whole conversation. I have heard of him
from various persons; Campbell, the poet, furnished me with the latter
particulars.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OPENING OF PARLIAMENT</div>

<p>The debate on the Address went off very triumphantly for the Opposition
in the Lords, and, as far as the negative success of the failure of
Ministers in making an impression, did so in the Commons. Ld. Grenville
made a masterly speech in which he pressed strongly the atrocity of the
Copenhagen business, the impolicy of their conduct with regard to the
U. States, rather depreciated the prospect of the advantages of the
emigration of the Portuguese to <i>Brésil</i>, and touched lightly upon
peace. The novelty of the night was Ld. Kenyon,<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> who did not acquit
himself <i>formidably</i>. Some considered Mr. G. Ponsonby’s speech as
a complete failure, but more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span> temperate judges say it was not so, and
the accident of not moving the Amendment arose from a misapprehension
of more protests than his alone. Mr. Canning appears to have assumed
the lead, and by an endeavour to appear dignified he was heavy and
obscure, instead of being, as formerly, pretty flippant. Perceval
excelled him much, but the fair ones allow there was not a good speech
made in the whole debate. Mr. C. professed that Governt. had laid down
a rule, which was to act directly contrary to what they found had been
the conduct of their predecessors, and hitherto they had not erred.</p>

<p>On Monday, the 1st of Feb., we moved to Pall Mall. I had been confined
many days with a smart inflammation in my eyes.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, 3rd Feb., a long debate in the Commons on Mr. Ponsonby’s
motion for further papers on the Danish Expedition.<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> Altho’ he had
spoken before, yet this was considered as a debut; his friends were
rather anxious, as his forte lies more in reply than in the opening
of a business. However, he acquitted himself well, and people seem to
be generally satisfied with him. He was answered by Mr. Canning in a
speech remarkable chiefly from its length, and the abundance of gross
untruths; he read extracts out of those very despatches he refused to
give to the House, and in one instance (a dispatch of Ld. Howick’s
to Mr. Garlike) read a sentence which, if he had read the context,
would have given a different colour to the whole matter. He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span> very
flippant and offensive, and showed neither more nor less ability
than usual. Mr. Mills<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> [<i>sic</i>], his <i>élève</i>, was quite
extinguished; it was the first occasion on which he had attempted to
speak without previously writing his speech, so he is completely given
up by all and laughed at by his own party. Ld. Palmerston’s maiden
speech was not attended either with the bad or good qualities of a
young beginner; he had practised in debating societies, and formed an
unimpressive, bad manner. Some of Opposition who are for the expedition
yet voted upon this question, but would not if it had been a vote
against the Ministry for that measure. Upon the whole the effect of the
debate was rather against Opposition.</p>

<p>Sick of, and indifferent to the measures of a hopeless Opposition, I
have omitted noticing any occurrence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SOLANO’S DEATH</div>

<p><i>July 1808.</i>—Mr. Campbell, whom we knew at Madrid, returned
from Spain with the Deputies from Seville.<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> He remained at Cadiz
during the disturbances, surrender of the French fleet, and murder
of Solano.<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> The conduct of Solano he ascribed to the greatest
infatuation, proceeding from a blind confidence in O’Farrill.<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> The
leading people at and about Cadiz, as soon as Murat’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span> massacre<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>
on the 2nd of May was known, urged Solano to hoist the Spanish flag
alone, and summon the French fleet to surrender to the Spaniards. He
temporised; he was at length threatened that unless he did something
decisive against the French by the ensuing day, his life should answer
for his conduct. The people showed great symptoms of discontent, called
him <i>embustero</i>, &amp;c. Amongst the mob many persons supposed of
eminence were in disguise. During this period of hesitation on his
part, young Perico Giron (whom we knew intimately at Madrid) escaped,
upon hearing the events at Madrid, from his regiment at Badajoz, and
arrived at Cadiz and challenged Solano. But no duel took place, for the
fatal day came when the people assembled tumultuously around his house,
called for him to appear and justify his inaction, none of the measures
required by the inhabitants having been adopted. He appeared upon his
balcony. The sight of him seemed to incense the mob; they attempted
to force the entrance of the house, the gateways were barricaded.
Upon seeing their fury, he got through the roof of his own house, and
gained admittance into that of Mr. Strange (an Irish wine merchant),
where he was concealed in a hiding-place so effectually that the mob,
after searching, as they imagined, every place, were going off, when
unfortunately a man, who had been employed only 14 days before to paint
over a panel in order to cover a hiding-place, betrayed the concealment
and discovered Solano. He made no resistance; the people hurried him to
the place of execution. In going thither, some person said he ought to
have a priest, upon which Solano said that it was unnecessary, as he
had nothing to confess; this he frequently repeated,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span> till at length
the mob lost all restraint, and upwards of fifty bayonets were plunged
into his body, and his corpse was hacked and mutilated shockingly in a
moment.</p>

<p>As soon as this disgraceful act of cruelty was over, the necessity of
having some Governt. was felt, and it was agreed almost by acclamation
that Morla, Don Thomas Morla, who had formerly been the Captain-General
of Andalusia, and had distinguished himself by the prompt and decisive
measures which he had taken to prevent the progress of the yellow
fever, was the best fitted to fill the station now vacant. Morla, it
was supposed, had not entirely made up his mind as to the side he
should take, and that, like Solano, he waited for Dupont’s<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> army.
However, he had no choice, and accepted with reluctance the honour. He
harangued the people with great ability and fortitude, assured them
that if he undertook the charge he would fulfil it rigidly; that they
knew him to be inflexible, nor should he depart from what he thought
his duty, notwithstanding the dreadful spectacle he had just beheld.
He gave an immediate proof of his cleverness and dexterity; during the
tumult, about eight hundred of the <i>Presidarios</i>, galley-slaves,
broke into the Arsenal, armed themselves and others. Morla was aware of
the danger, and also of the impolicy of allowing such men to bear arms,
and resolved upon disarming them instantly. He ordered processions
to be made through the streets of the Capucins and other Franciscan
friars, who were to chant hymns and prayers requesting the citizens to
lay down their arms. By night almost all the inhabitants had deposited
their arms at the feet of the friars.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DUKE OF INFANTADO</div>

<p>I was pleased to find such a favourable opinion prevailed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span> with regard
to the Duke of Infantado.<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> He had been exiled from his own estates,
and lived at San Lucar, where he had acquired the esteem and confidence
of all who saw him. Thus his conduct at Bayonne is conceived to arise
entirely from compulsion. He was dismissed the Court in consequence
of that affair at the Escorial in which he was involved, as there was
a paper found in his possession signed by the Prince of the Asturias,
nominating him as President of Castille, in which capacity he would
have had the governt. of the country. The Prince contended that this
instrument could have had no power but after his mother’s death, in
proof of which he alleged that the seal was affixed upon black wax, and
it was only to obviate the danger that might have arisen in the country
should his mother and the Prince of the Peace have been able to shut
him up and attempt an exclusion or Regency.</p>

<p>We went in July to Woburn; Mr. Brougham was with us. Our party
consisted of Lauderdale, D. of Argyle, W. Elliot, Adam, etc. Extremely
pleasant place, both grand and comfortable, and the park very pretty
in some parts. Went over to see Luton, belonging to Ld. Bute. The
house was built by his father, the Minister, and does no credit to his
choice of an architect, the Adams. The collection of pictures is very
numerous, the Flemish and Dutch schools are the finest, altho’ amongst
the great number of Italian pictures some are good. The most remarkable
portraits are those grouped with some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span> malicious skill by Sr. Joshua.
They are those of Ld. Bute and his Secretary, Jenkinson, now Ld.
Liverpool.<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> The Prime Minister is represented with all the pomp and
dignity of office, a splendid dress and commanding air; he is taking,
rather than receiving, from his Secretary a bundle of papers, which
the Secretary, with a most submissive air, is holding in his hands.
The story tells itself,—the Duke of Lerma and Gil Blas; the abject,
fawning, sly Secretary, and the haughty great man. People say Sr.
Joshua Reynolds marked the characters so strongly in order to stamp the
origin of a man, whose sneaking qualities he foresaw would raise him
to distinction. Ld. Liverpool, I have been assured, offered frequently
a very large sum to withdraw from the eye of the public this memorial.
The Library is very extensive, and the three rooms which join it are
handsome, altho’ it might have been infinitely better.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WILLIAM BELSHAM</div>

<p>We went to Hinckley to see Henry E., who had been there about a month
with his aunt; his limb is not worse. From thence for one night to
Farming Woods, belonging to Ld. Ossory; charming spot, fine trees,
abundance of deer, and wild woodland scenery. Slept at Bromham,
Mr. Trevor’s, a pretty water place on the banks of the Ouse. From
thence for three nights to Mr. Whitbread’s at Southill. Ly. Madelina
Palmer<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> was there. With the exception of the Trevors for one day,
the rest of the company was <i>remplissage</i> of the very worst
sort, fulsome flatterers, and disgusting dependents. Mr. Belsham, the
gazetteer or pamphleteer, who calls his heavy compilation a History of
England, was one of them; his manners and appearance are positively
offensive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span> to all the senses. He extols Whitbread to the skies, and
makes him believe no man can serve the country with equal talents and
honesty, and that nothing but Ld. Grey’s envy at his superiority could
have kept him out of the highest offices in the late Administration.
He has composed a virulent libel against the late Governt., which he
circulates about the country, and boasts of his forbearance, that out
of consideration to Mr. Whitbread’s <i>affection</i> for Ld. Grey that
he does not publish it. It is particularly offensive to Grey, and the
subject most urged is the failure of the negotiation. Mr. W. has an
unfortunate relish for the society he indulges in at Southill.</p>

<p>Returned on Thursday, 11th August. On ye 19th August news arrived
officially from Ld. Collingwood of Dupont’s surrender to Castaños in
Andalusia.<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></p>

<p><i>16th August.</i> The Spanish Deputies dined here. They are five in
all, viz., Visconde de Matarosa<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> and Don Andres de la Vega (these
were the first, who came from the Junta of Oviedo). The Visconde is
a very young man, not above 19; la Vega is a sensible, well-informed
man, esteemed by his countryman Jovellanos. Sangro is the Deputy from
Galicia; he had been named to go to Bayonne, but escaped and was sent
with another, Freyne,<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> who has since returned to Coruña with
arms, &amp;c., &amp;c. The Sevillian Deputies are Jacome and Apodaca. Jacome
is a member of the Junta at Seville. The latter is the admiral who
commanded these last two years at Cadiz, and to whom the French fleet
surrendered. He is very lively and pleasing in his manners, and of the
whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span> mission he is the one who has the most <i>usage du monde</i>.</p>

<p>He ascribes the misfortune of Solano to the machinations of a faction
actuated by personal hatred. Had Solano complied with the demands of
the mob, the consequence would have been the complete destruction of
their own fleet, as at that moment the ships were so intermingled that
the French could have sunk the Spaniards. Apodaca seemed satisfied
with himself for his dexterity in getting out the Spaniards and not
endangering them. They were in great spirits at the surrender of
Dupont, and also at the news of the evacuation of Madrid. It appears
that Joseph Bonaparte withdrew from thence on ye 29th, after staying
only 3 days in <i>his</i> Capital, rather hastily, with the spoils
and plunder of the palaces. He is at Segovia, with a force of 23,000,
waiting orders from Napoleon. Moncey and his shattered Valencian army
are with him. Mr. Vaughan writes from Coruña that Mr. Stuart (who was
formerly at Petersburg) was received with great demonstrations of
regard and friendship; the officers, naval and military, had shown him
Ferrol, and as he returned the villages were illuminated. They had
heard of Sr. A. Wellesley’s landing at the mouth of the Mondego, the
river so praised by Camoens.</p>

<p>We left home on Sunday, August 22nd, for this place Boundes, Ld. Hy.
Petty’s. Made an excursion from thence along the coast from Hastings to
Brighton; passed a few days at Mr. Beauclerk’s, and returned home, 1st
September.</p>

<p>At the end of October the Hollands set out for Spain, and

<div class="sidenote">LORD LANSDOWNE’S DEATH</div>

<p><i>22nd Nov.</i>—It is too distant from this present period to make
a review of all the occurrences from that time to this. Mr. Canning
and Ld. Castlereagh fought on 21st Sept. Ld. Wellesley has accepted
his recall,<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> and is daily expected; many believe he is coming upon
the misapprehension that the Premiership has been offered to him.
Lord Lansdowne<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> died on 14th Nov., which event is fatal to the
Opposition by removing Petty from the H. of Commons. He has endeavoured
to annoy Petty by his will and much disrespect for his father’s family,
by making the remainder over to Ld. Winchilsea, and then to Ly.
Lansdowne and her 2nd daughter.<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> To the latter, they say, a lease

read in eve. Berington’s <i>Life of Henry II.</i>, a work not without

of Becket is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span> well drawn, and from his close researches into monkish
chronicles he gives many interesting anecdotes which throw light upon
the manners and mode of life in those times. He is a Roman Catholic
priest, and tho’ one sees a bias, yet he has more liberality than usual
with persons of his class. Indeed, at Rome he was suspected of giving
up the cause of the Church too much: accordingly for some time he was
suspended from his clerical functions by a papal mandate. He is also
the author of a life of <i>Abelard and Eloïsa</i>, and possesses in

learning.</p>

<p>Mr. Canning wrote to Ld. G. Leveson: ‘Lord Chuckle [<i>sic</i>] is, I
hear, sufficiently recovered to take his prescription; accordingly, I
shall send my letter to-morrow, and the other shall go abroad the day
following.’ So we may expect to-morrow to see this long announced and
much looked-for <i>second</i> statement.<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a></p>

<p>Henry and his tutor, Mr. Shuttleworth, left us on Sunday for Hinckley.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, 22nd.</i>—Mr. Tierney, Mr. Grenville, and Ld. Darnley
dined.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, 23rd Nov.</i>—Ministerial papers announce very
triumphantly that Ld. Wellesley has accepted the office offered to him
by them, and is to come home immediately and fill his place.</p>

<p>Ly. Eliz.<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> came, the first time I have seen her since her marriage
with Duke of Devonshire; I could not utter a congratulation upon the
occasion. The Lambs, Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span> Windham, S. Lockington, Sr. Robt. Wilson, Mr.
Stuart, Duke of Argyle, Ld. Robt. FitzGerald, Ly. Affleck dined.</p>

<p>Mr. C.’s statement is not yet out. My mother returned from Gosport with
Charles, whom she had been to see on acct. of his illness.</p>

<p><i>Friday, 24th Nov.</i>—Ld. Wellesley has written to Mr. Canning
assigning his reasons for accepting, but what they are I know not.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PANSHANGER</div>

<p><i>14th Dec., 1809.</i>—The Whig Corporation of Nottingham having done
Ld. H. the honour of choosing him their Recorder, vacant by the death
of the D. of Portland, it was necessary for him to go there and take
the oaths. Accordingly we took the opportunity of making the journey
in part with him, and of paying some visits on our way, for change of
air for me after a confinement is indispensable to keep off a whole
train of nervous disorders, and I did not much relish the notion of a
trip to Nottingham to share his civic honours. On this day we went to
<i>Panshanger</i>, on the <i>banks of the Mimram</i>, a very Asiatic
sound! A pretty place of Lord Cowper’s in Hertfordshire. We took
Tierney with us. Found besides the family, Lds. Essex, Erskine, and Mr.
Giles Lewis. No news of the result of the election at Oxford,<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> but
the Grenvilles began to despond.</p>

<p>Drove out to see the new college at Haileybury, a large, ugly,
mean-looking conventual building. In the eve, news came of Lord
Grenville’s success at Oxford; carried it by a majority of 13.</p>

<p><i>15th.</i>—Drove to Woolmers, a dismal, damp, ill-kept house,
belonging to Ld. Stafford. It was too cold to walk to the spring, and,
indeed, I am too lame to undertake any excursion on foot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span></p>

<p><i>16th, Sunday.</i>—We were to have gone away, but delayed our
departure in order to see Ly. Melbourne, who was coming on the ensuing
day.</p>

<p><i>17th.</i>—Ly. Melbourne came.</p>

<p><i>18th, Tuesday.</i>—Set off and resolved to go as far as we could,
as Ld. H. was to be at Nottingham to a great dinner on Wednesday. The
roads were in a very bad condition owing to the great fall of rain;
however, we reached Stamford and slept.</p>

<p><i>19th.</i>—Ld. H. set off alone to Nottingham. Mr. Allen, Charles,
and I went to see Burleigh, a stately edifice, not improved by the
bad taste of the last proprietor. A few good pictures, and several
beautiful portraits of Mde. de la Vallière after her profession, in the
dress of the Order. Ascertained that the story of Ld. Exeter having
made a bonfire, in the courtyard, of Voltaire, Rousseau, &amp;c., was true.
This was done to edify the people at Stamford during the <i>alarm</i>,
to teach them to shun the doctrines of those apostates from religion,
morality, &amp;c. From thence we went to Grantham, where I resolved to take
up my abode till Ld. H. returned.</p>

<p><i>20th.</i>—Went to see Belvoir, which is undergoing a thorough
reparation and improvement by Wyatt. It commands a staring, ugly view
of the Vale of Belvoir. The antique baronial costume of the castle is
destroyed by the introduction of modern fortifications and of artillery
mounted upon the walls. The collection of pictures is very good. The
famous ‘Sacraments’ of <i>Poussin</i>, and a pretty <i>Murillo</i> with
three Virgins in white, exactly in the style of those in the famous
‘Transito de Santa Clara,’ in the convent at Seville. We sent for
<i>novels</i> to the circulating library, and sat up reading the trash
it furnished half the night.</p>

<p><i>21st.</i>—Ld. H. returned pleased with the reception he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span> had met
with from his fellow Burgesses, and we got on to Stilton, a bad, dismal
inn.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CAMBRIDGE</div>

<p><i>22nd.</i>—We went to Cambridge, to show Mr. A. the colleges, &amp;c.
Got there by daylight. Dr. Davy,<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> the Master of Caius College, made
us dine with him; a good-natured, trifling, insignificant man. Lord
Percy, Dukes of Rutland and Gloster are to be the candidates for the
Chancellorship, whenever the D. of Grafton will die and give them an
opportunity of trying their popularity.</p>

<p><i>23rd.</i>—A fall of snow which rendered the walking across the
Quadrangle unpleasant. The Library at Trinity is very handsome, but
the books are the least to be praised in it. A good bust of Newton.
The chapel contains a statue of Newton; the countenance is full of
expression and genius, but the sculpture is very moderate, altho’
considered by them as a <i>chef-d’œuvre</i>. Went to the chapel of
King’s College. Glad that my recollection of Batalha was so fresh that
it enabled me to compare the architectural styles and beauties. That of
Batalha<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> is generally superior in execution, the taste of King’s
chapel perhaps is more chaste and simple, but it does not possess one
specimen of exquisite delicacy of sculpture; the roses and portcullis
are coarsely carved.</p>

<p>Passed through Eaton and Bedford. Reached Ampthill to a late dinner.
Waters very much out.</p>

<p><i>24th, Ampthill.</i>—Ld. Ossory as usual kind and very pleasant.
Capt. Waldegrave, a cousin, and son of Lady Waldegrave. Our old
shipmate, Sr. John Sinclair, Dr. Hunt, &amp;c. A contagious fever at
Southill prevents our visit; Lady Elizabeth ill. Mr. Whitbread came
over to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span> see us, much offended and irritated at the anonymous circular;
ascribes all as intended offences from Grey and Tierney to <i>him</i>.
Reached Brocket on the 27th.</p>

<p><i>28th, Brocket.</i>—Large family party with the addition of Messrs,
Luttrell and Nugent. Ld. Kinnaird dined one day, grave, good-humoured,
and agreeable; his illness has subdued and softened his naturally
irritable character. We were to have set off again on the 1st January
for Woburn, but I was seized with such a severe headache that I was
compelled to return to my bed; sent an excuse for that day to the D. of
B. by Aleck, who was to meet us at St. Albans on the following day.</p>

<p><i>Monday, 2nd January, 1810.</i>—Very much alarmed at the account
brought by Aleck of Charles having met with a severe fall. Contrary to
a promise given me by Lady Anne (and his uncle),<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> she allowed him
to go out with her to a fox chase. He cut the inside of his leg between
ham and knee dreadfully. Reached Woburn late, and after a hasty dinner
Mr. A. and I set off to see Charles; found him with fever. Went again
next day to see the wound; found it a most dreadful gash, as bad as
anything can be which has not touched a vital part, and may not perhaps
do him a permanent injury.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, 7th.</i>—Ld. H. was so much pressed to go to town that he
went to see Lds. Grey and Grenville, and dined at Mr. Grenville’s. Duke
of B. went next day and returned to dinner, bringing Lord Holland down
with him. Ld. Kinnaird, Mr. Chester, Delmé Gunning, Morrice, General
Fitzpatrick, Tavistocks, &amp;c., compose off and on the party.</p>

<p><i>10th Jan.</i>—We this day brought Charles over from Ampthill, who
bore the motion of the carriage tolerably. He will oblige us to defer
going away much longer than we intended to be absent from home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">DEBATE ON THE ADDRESS</div>

<p>Left Woburn on ——. Stayed at H.H. until Monday, 22nd Jan., the eve
of the meeting of Parlt., and on that day took possession of our
former dirty habitation in Pall Mall. On 23rd there were very sanguine
expectations entertained of not only a good division, but even of a
majority of 13 in the Commons, it being confidently asserted that many
of the stoutest adherents of the former Ministry would keep away, such
as the Lascelles’, Pagets, Ld. Newark, &amp;c. However, every one of these
came up, and after a flat debate the majority was all on the wrong
side. Numbers, 167 to 263.<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Ward made a brilliant display, and all the young gentlemen, movers
and seconders, acquitted themselves with propriety. Mr. Canning voted
for the Address in a bad, blundering speech, in which he did not redeem
the pledge he had made of justifying himself in his place in Parlt.
It was rather a whimsical coincidence that Ld. G. Leveson could not
vote, not being <i>in time</i> to take his seat. This is the third
time in his Parliamentary life that he has been baffled in voting
upon dubious occasions however. In the Lords the attempt to stir Ld.
Wellesley failed. Lord Grey’s speech was a most finished oration. The
division was great, 92; numbers which would formerly have broken up any
Administration.<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a></p>

<p>On Friday Lord Porchester’s motion of inquiry into the Walcheren
expedition was most unexpectedly carried by a majority of 9 against
Ministers.<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> Wilberforce behaved in the most flagrant but sanctified
manner; he deserted his friend Perceval at the critical pinch.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span> Mr.
Ponsonby is recovering his reputation; he made a sharp, sarcastic
speech which produced a considerable effect and reconciled those who
had <i>snouched</i> most at him. Mr. Canning acted against inquiry, and
upon observing to Ld. Temple that he (Ld. Temple) was in a majority,
was answered, ‘Yes, and the best part of it is that it was without yr.
assistance.’ Ld. Castlereagh, whose manly conduct and being considered
as an injured man by the House has conciliated him much public esteem,
voted for the inquiry.</p>

<p>Ld. Wellesley made his debut in the character of Minister upon the
thanks of the House being moved to Ld. Wellington. Some commend, and
others disparage his speech; perhaps the middle line of praise would be
nearest the truth. He was rather oriental in his style of praising his
brother, but much may be owing to his feelings upon such a subject as
that of his brother’s merits undergoing a slighting review.</p>

<p>Poor Hoppner, the painter, is dead. Public attention and sympathy has
been fixed by the sudden and mysterious disappearance of Mr. Eden,<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a>
who left his father’s house in Old Palace Yard on Friday eve., having
previously told his servant he should return in an hour, and from that
time to this, an interval of ten days has elapsed without any tidings.
A man was seen on that Friday, at 9 o’clock, scrambling upon the ice on
the Thames, who, upon being called upon to stop, rushed on and plunged
into the stream. Poor young man, he was to all appearance the last
person in the world likely to lay violent hands upon himself.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, 28th Jan., 1810, Pall Mall.</i>—A belief afloat that Prince
Stahremberg is the bearer of an offer of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span> peace from Ld. Wellesley to
Napoleon. He went yesterday to Paris.</p>

<p>Lds. Thanet, Erskine, Sr. Philip Francis, and Don Domingo de Souza<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a>
dined.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">WINDHAM’S WILL</div>

<p><i>June, 1810.</i>—It appears that Windham from the period of his
leaving College had kept a diary; the last entry was on the day the
operation was decided.<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> He says: ‘This day sentence has been passed
upon me,’ It fills 15 vols. in 4to., and according to his will is
annexed as an heirloom to the proprietor of Fellbrigge; so in case of
failure of issue in Capt. Lukin, it will fall into the hands of the
Egremont family. A curious instance of weakness in Windham, and one
that probably never would have been drawn forth, but for the feelings
stirred up by the French Revolution: he has put Lord Egremont into the
entail of his estate, treating him as a relation. During his life the
relationship was never claimed, and certainly not admitted, either
by him or by Ld. Egremont; the mode of spelling the name is quite
different. He left six thousand pr. ann., at least, to his wife, who
has most indecorously exposed to public sale all his books and common
pamphlets; the latter especially are scribbled over entirely with
his own observations on the margin. These have been bought up by the
booksellers, and will hereafter be sold as immensely valuable from
possessing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span> his notes. There is a pamphlet of Sr. S. Romilly’s upon the
state of Criminal Law, which is entirely written over by W.; and the
strictures intended merely for himself to reply to in the H. of Commons
are most likely not calculated to please Romilly, or indeed could they
have been designed for his eye.</p>

<p>When Perceval proposed last year, 1809, to Lord Grenville and Grey to
form a <i>part</i> of his Administration, some private correspondence
in consequence of this overture took place between these Lords. They
agreed perfectly in the propriety of rejecting the terms as proposed,
but as it was just possible they might be addressed again upon a
similar occasion, they discussed the state of their own views, &amp;c.
Ld. Grenville told Grey that whenever they came into office, and
were enabled to make the concessions deemed necessary to the Irish
Catholics, he intended to propose that his brother, Lord Buckingham,
should be the person sent over; that he had always contributed so
disinterestedly to the support of the party, that as it was his wish to
go, he considered him entitled to it. This hint was not relished, nor
was it combated; but the Grenvilles are great graspers and encroachers.</p>

<p>At the Installation<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> Lord Grenville promised the heads of Houses to
supply them with venison, having been promised by his brother 15 brace.
A few days before the festival Ld. B. sent to say he could not furnish
any venison, and but for the good nature of private friends he would
not have been able to fulfil his engagement. The Duke of Bedford told
me this, and was one of the persons applied to, and gave 4 brace. Ld.
B. is envious of his brother, and enjoys his feeling any mortification.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="sidenote">THE LAKE COUNTRY</div>

<p>We made an excursion for seven weeks to the North<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span> in order to amuse
Henry, and try the effect of change of air, as he was not well. We
went by Derby and Lancashire to Appleby Castle, Ld. Thanet’s. We
stayed there a few days in order that Ld. H. might get some fishing;
from thence we went to the Lake of Ullswater, and dined at Patterdale.
Returned and slept at Penrith.</p>

<p>At Keswick we saw Southey, who was very agreeable; he is just about
publishing two epic poems. Windermere is the pleasantest and most
agreeable of all the Lakes to my taste. Mr. Dumont was of our party.
We went rather impromptu to Edinburgh, by the Kelso road, to see
Melrose Abbey. Kelso is a charmingly situated town and exceedingly
pretty. Melrose Abbey disappointed me greatly, especially after John
Clerk’s praise, who described it as the finest remains of the richly
wrought Gothic in the Island. I did not mind Walter Scott’s poetry,
but was very considerably chagrined at its being so very inferior to
many even in England. The high roads now making in Scotland are very
characteristic of the nation; they are <i>scientific and thrifty</i>,
for they are upon good principles, but are excessively dangerous and
alarming from the parsimony with which they are executed. They are
contrived to go upon the mountains like terraces or ledges, so that the
up and down is avoided, but then they are rather narrow, and there is
not the smallest parapet or any protection which intervenes between the
poor traveller and the deep valley below.</p>

<p>We remained only two days at Edinbro’. During that time poor Lady
Rosslyn<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> died unexpectedly at Rockville. We dined one day with Mr.
Clerk,<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> and were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span> visited by the few persons then in town—Jeffrey,
Murray, &amp;c. We went to Dunbar; then to Howick; and spent a couple of
days with Sydney Smith at Heslington, near York. I went to the Roman
Catholic convent in York, to visit the daughters of Mr. Gordon, of
Xeres; they seemed dejected and apprehensive that the state of Spain
would prevent them from joining their family.</p>

<p>We made a deviation from the North road to see Lincoln Minster. We were
repaid for the inconvenience of a very bad road and without exception
the worst inn in England, as the Cathedral is very curious and
magnificent. It is not so large as that of York, but the workmanship
is much richer. I was startled when I entered the Cathedral at York; I
could scarcely credit that it was the identical building which appeared
spacious and lofty formerly, my eye having been recently so accustomed
to the Cathedral at Seville which is about three times the size of
York. At York the centre aisle is wide, but the two side aisles are
narrow and low, whereas at Seville there are five aisles all equally
wide and lofty, and <i>beyond</i> are large side chapels (at York there
are none).</p>

<p>From Lincoln we went through Spalding to Peterboro’; I asked at
Spalding how far off it was to the Fens. The postmaster replied that
there were no fens in Lincolnshire now, and that geese were full as
scarce as in Middlesex or elsewhere. I think it impossible he can be
correct, for, tho’ draining may do much, yet I remember such dykes and
embankments against the waters then covered with flocks of geese, about
23 years ago, that it cannot be possible those waters can have been
carried off, the bottom made sound, and put into tillage; about Boston
and Crowland I meant. Peterboro’ Cathedral has a beautiful façade;
the inside is not worth much.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span> Katherine of Arragon and Queen Mary of
Scotland<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> are buried there.</p>

<p>We returned here<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> on August 2, and found all well; the library
wall rebuilt, but the house not in a condition for our reception.
Accordingly we are going off in a few days to inhabit the Govt. House
at Portsmouth, which Genl. Fox has lent most kindly to us.<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">GENERAL FERGUSON</div>

<p>The few days we have been here we have seen Tom Sheridan and his
wife, Ld. Erskine, D. of Argyle, Ld. Robt., Gen. Tupper, Mr. Whishaw,
Kemble, Gen. Fox, Caroline Fox. I went one night to the Haymarket and
saw the <i>Iron Chest</i>. General Ferguson<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> has been compelled
to leave Cadiz on acct. of his health; he is afflicted with a liver
complaint which is always aggravated in a hot climate. He acted the
part of a real friend to our dear boy,<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> he went out with him in
the <i>Lively</i>, and assumed a parental authority over him. He also,
upon arriving at Cadiz, removed him from that ship, and placed him with
Capt. Codrington of the <i>Blake</i>, where he now is, and is gone up
to Minorca to escort the Spanish ships from Cadiz thither. He confirms
the stories of the desertions from the French armies, and himself
conversed with <i>three</i> native-born Frenchmen, who had deserted
from want of pay and want of food, the most pressing want.</p>

<p>On Thursday, — August, left home for Portsmouth.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span> Henry, &amp;c.,
accompanied us; the girls were to follow a few days later. Mr. Dumont
came with us; we slept at Liphook, and reached Portsmouth on Friday.
The Government House is a very large, rambling habitation, and was
formerly a Cistercian convent.<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> From the interior arrangement of
the rooms, and very inconvenient distribution of space, one can still
trace its monastic origin. The conventual church, now converted into
the garrison chapel, communicates with the great apartment, and access
is immediate into the tribune. In that church Charles the Second
married the Infanta of Portugal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CAPTAIN MOORE</div>

<p>The <i>séjour</i> of this place has little to recommend it in the
way of drives or walks, as the confinement of a garrison town is
inconvenient for either, and indeed the whole neighbourhood more or
less partakes of the stir and din of war. We see a few naval and
military persons. General Whetham, the Lt.-Governor, a sprightly man,
who talks good French, and has a superficial smattering of the light
reading in that language; he was wounded in Flanders, and is a great
favourite upon the Terrace at Windsor. Capt. G. Moore,<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> the brother
of the General, whose good sense seems to have been bestowed in a fair
division upon him, is a pleasing, well-informed, manly, gentlemanlike
person. They are an affectionate, united family, and full of amiable
qualities; he alluded to Sir John with feeling, his eyes were full
of tears when in the course of some conversation he mentioned the
narrative written by his brother James.<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> He told me that had the
General<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span> lived to return and lay aside his command, it was his opinion
that an explanation must have taken place with Frere, as the gross
personality and insulting language in his correspondence must have
been apologised for or determined(?) in some decisive manner. Capt.
Moore was at Lisbon when the Court embarked for the <i>Brésils</i>, and
accompanied the Portuguese squadron thither, having on board many of
the attendants and dependants of the Prince Regent.</p>

<p><i>21st Sept., 1810.</i>—Capt. Moore told us that one day at Rio
Janeiro when Sr. Sidney Smith presented Capt. Schomberg to the Prince
Regent, the Prince said he was exceedingly happy to see Capt. S. again,
as he was the first Englishman he had seen after he left Lisbon.<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a>
This was said by the Prince in a particularly marked manner, as if
he meant it to convey an indirect contradiction of Ld. Strangford’s
account in the Gazette of what passed on that occasion. Capt. Schomberg
was Sir S. Smith’s Captain when the Portuguese Court embarked for
<i>Brésil</i>, and was sent in a boat to the Prince’s ship, on board
of which he went after it was on the outside of the bar. Sir S. Smith
and Ld. Strangford went afterwards on board the P.’s ship together.
Capt. Moore is persuaded that Strangford never saw the P. R. till
he went on board of his ship with Sir Sidney. Capt. Moore saw the
<i>Confiance</i>, on board of which was Ld. S., attempting the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span> night
before to get over the bar, and observed to someone near him that
Yeo (the commander of the <i>Confiance</i>) would not get to Lisbon
before it was dark. The Prince weighed anchor next morning before it
was light. We knew from Setaro how Strangford passed that night, and
that the Prince had left his palace and embarked with an intention of
sailing with the first fair wind two days before.</p>

<p>We have also seen Don Tomaso Blanco, the 2nd-in-command on board the
<i>Algescias</i>; he is the cousin of the author of the <i>Español</i>.
He gave me the news of Mde. Ariza having returned to Madrid, where she
was acting a considerable part owing to the influence she possesses
over Urquijo.<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> He was a dependent originally of the Alba family,
and owed his station in life to their favour and influence, which
she now avails herself of by claiming in return his protection.
The Town Major, who is under our roof, dined with us. Ld. Amelius
Beauclerk,<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> a nephew of Ld. Bessboro’s, and very like a Cavendish
in his appearance and demeanour. Capt. Irwin, the commander of the
<i>Puissant</i>, a sheer hulk, on board of which Charles was mustered
during the period of his residence at Dr. Burney’s at Gosport.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FRENCH PRISONERS</div>

<p>Great alarm prevails amongst those military in office, such as General
Whetham and Sr. Roger Curtis,<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> in regard to the French prisoners.
There are 17,000 at Gosport, and, in the hulks 4000 convicts lie very
close to them, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span> Governt., by some strange mismanagement, has
allowed French officers on their parole to live in this neighbourhood.
They say there is a general system of organisation, that each officer
has his corps, that a correspondence is maintained between them and
Napoleon’s Govt., and that it is his policy to keep them in this
country so that they might assist him in the case of an invasion. There
was in the winter 40,000 prisoners; the number is increased to 70,000
at present.</p>

<p>We drive and walk out in the morning, and our evenings are
usually employed in reading or hearing Mr. Dumont read French.
The <i>Lively</i> was wrecked on the rocks near Malta; the fault
is ascribed to the Lieut. of the watch and the Master. The former
neglected his official duty of apprising the captain when they made
land. This accident happened early in Sept.; it made my heart ache,
notwithstanding Charles is safely deposited in another ship. Capt.
Stewart, of the <i>Seahorse</i>, now stationed at Palermo, to whom
Charles was recommended by Gen. Fox and Ld. Keith (it being our
intention that he should join him in the Mediterranean), being apprised
of his sailing in the <i>Lively</i>, immediately upon hearing she was
wrecked sent express to Malta to order him a supply of money and proper
equipment, and also to secure a speedy passage from thence to him. All
this was done in a most obliging and gentlemanlike manner, so as to
leave a strong desire upon my mind of returning the civility whenever
any opportunity should occur.</p>

prices of all the articles of life, and by maintaining a correspondence
with the enemy’s Courts in Italy. Murat, with his 40,000 men, was
encamped within sight, and whenever the Toulon fleet can assist him a
descent may be expected upon the Island, and already the blockading
fleet has been driven twice from Toulon as far down as Nice. I have
also a letter from Lady Amherst<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> written in great trepidation.</p>

<p>Miss Fox and Miss Vernon came to us; we lodged them in a tolerable

<p>On Saturday, 13th, we set off to spend a few days at Mr. Beauclerk’s.
Slept one night in our way at Arundel Castle. The alterations are not
completed, the whole is done upon a grand scale, but without much
taste, and without any comfort. The party was very numerous and far
from select, a <i>mêlée</i> of neighbours and various dependents. Sr.
Arthur Pigott<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> was the only person I was acquainted with. Met at
Beau.’s, Major Capel. He was in the Galician campaign, and considered
the retreat as so disgraceful, that had the Commander survived many
general officers, for their own justification, would have insisted upon
inquiry.</p>

<p>Slept a night on our return at Worthing, to see Lord and Lady
Lansdowne. Returned to Portsmouth on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span> Saturday, 20th October; remained
till 27th, and went to St. Anne’s, where we spent two nights. Returned
home on the 30th, and went to the play.</p>

<p>The King’s illness declared; it has long been suspected that the
physicians were detained as much on the account of the <i>father</i> as
on that of the daughter.<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">BATTLE OF BUSACO</div>

<p>In the <i>Apollo</i>, General Simon, who was made prisoner at the
affair of Busaco, came home. He tells a story of his having accompanied
Masséna to reconnoitre the position of Busaco, and that upon his
observing <i>que la position était forte</i>, Masséna with some
asperity replied, ‘Yes, but I have seen many stronger forced.’ Simon
construed this retort into a reproof, and answered only by requesting
that if any attack was to be made, he might be entrusted to lead on
that occasion. Accordingly he commanded a division on that day; the
ascent was so steep that he was compelled to dismount, and was soon
surrounded, and made prisoner.<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a></p>

<p>The King being incapable of affixing the sign manual to the Act for the
further prorogation of Parliament, the two Houses met in consequence of
the prorogation expiring on Nov. 1st. It being an unexpected meeting,
very few persons, especially of Opposition, were present. Ministers,
however, had foreseen the event for a day or two, and Treasury Notes
were issued and messengers sent to Cheveley and other Ministerial
houses in the country. Ld. H. supported the proposal of adjournment
and deprecated all discussion, adding that he could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span> have wished
the adjournment had been from day to day only. Sheridan flourished,
and affected to speak the sentiments of the Prince. He had artfully
fortified Tierney in his unsettled feeling upon the occasion, and
Tierney had injudiciously, in consequence of some strange crotchet,
abstained from going down. The Prince resides at Windsor, and conducts
himself with very unusual discretion; he has not seen or sent to any
person whatever. Sheridan has attempted to see him, but hitherto
without success.</p>

<p><i>2nd Nov.</i>—Pss. Amelia died. She was the youngest, the prettiest,
and the most beloved of all the Princesses; her life had been
artificially prolonged but to suffer, as her complaints were incurable
and of excruciating pain. Previous to her receiving the Sacrament,
in compliance with the earnest entreaty of the Prince, she consented
to see the Queen, with whom she had inflexibly refused to have an
interview, saying that she ascribed the misery she had undergone for 10
years, and perhaps her actual hopeless situation, to her hardness of
heart. After seeing her, she dictated a letter to the Prince telling
him that his <i>eloquence</i> had prevailed, and taught her to survive
resentment, the last feeling in the human breast.</p>

<p>The P. and D. of Cambridge are joint executors to her will, which the
Prince has determined shall not be proved. The P. behaved throughout
with the greatest tenderness, and previous to her death facilitated
their interviews. The P. is behaving with the utmost circumspection
and decorum, owing partly to the occupation of fulfilling his sister’s
wishes and ordering the ceremonial of the funeral with which he is
entrusted. He has not seen any of the Opposition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE KING’S ILLNESS</div>

<p>Ld. Grenville, who came to town yesterday (9th Nov.), has had two
visits from Tommy Tyrwhitt.<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> He represents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span> the first as an
inspection of his state of mind and body (reports being current that
he was bad and dying). He smiled and said he had passed muster very
well. The 2nd visit was to state the condition of the King, but
the communication was verbal, and the channel not such as to lead
to anything very confidential. If the bulletins between this and
Tuesday should be favourable, the news from Portugal good, and their
nerves strong, it is supposed Ministers will hazard the attempt of an
adjournment; if not, a summons for the meeting of the Privy Council
will be issued, and an examination of the physicians take place on
Wednesday, and their report be brought before the House and taken
into consideration on the day following that which is fixed for the
meeting. Probably even amongst themselves they are as yet undecided how
to proceed. Ld. G. Leveson (who speaks the language of Ld. Harrowby
probably, but does not adopt his views or sentiments) is of opinion
that if the Regency should be proposed, it will be clogged with
limitations and every species of restriction, and that any artifice
will be resorted to likely to incense the Opposition and impel them to
utter some rash expressions which will ruin them with the public.</p>

<p><i>14th Nov.</i>—Our leading Lords are each to maintain their former
doctrines in ’88. Ld. Grenville grounds his line upon the course he
adopted when he was Speaker, and refers to his speech, or rather book,
published with his authority. He even goes the length of consistency
so far as to hint that he would advise the P. to suggest himself the
limiting his powers as Regent; <i>par parenthèse</i>, if he were to
drop such an opinion at C. house, his favour would vanish instantly.
On the other hand, Ld. Grey is equally firm in maintaining his own
opinion, which he urged so strongly formerly. If this difference
between them should transpire before to-morrow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span> Ministers would avail
themselves of it and get them debating amongst themselves. Grey and
Lauderdale came up last night; I have been with them, and sitting for
two hours by the bedside of the latter, who is ill, and will hardly
be able to attend to-morrow. It is one of the few occasions when his
absence will perhaps be an advantage, as he would proclaim opinions
I fear he has imbued his companion with already too much, viz., that
it would be manly and due to the country to express the necessity of
the King’s abdicating even if he should recover from this temporary
derangement, for the loss of sight and increasing deafness are
infirmities incompatible with the performance of the kingly functions.
This uttered in public will completely ruin their cause; for, strange
as it may appear, the increasing maladies of the K. endear him to the
country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE KING’S ILLNESS</div>

<p>The jokers say that the K. reigns upon the <i>sense of taste and
touch</i>, having outlived the others. On Saturday he had a lucid
interval; he asked what had been done, for ‘I know my situation!’
Poor, wretched man, these returns of reason are most melancholy. Ld.
Moira was hurt and angry at not being sent for; he wrote up to C. H.
to know the reason. He was answered that the P. had neither written
nor sent to anybody. Such is Court favour! For who so favoured as he
was? Ld. Grenville says he <i>knows</i> that the K. was ill several
days before it was imparted to Perceval, but who knew it, or who caused
it to be kept secret, he does not know. The D. of York is behaving
ill to the P., taunting him with old allusions, and when there is a
favourable symptom exulting in a manner which denotes his joy that
they have a chance of escaping his dominion. The sending for Reynolds
and Willis was without the knowledge or consent of the R. family. Ld.
Grey shakes his hopes by his fears as to Portugal; he considers the
case as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span> desperate, and Ld. Wellington’s army quite ruined. This belief
is grounded upon Ponsonby information, and none of that family can be
credited, especially <i>Snouch</i><a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> and Ld. Ponsonby.</p>

<p>On the 15th Parlt. met in the Lords. The Chancellor and Ld. Liverpool
held out great hopes of a recovery. Ld. Grey worked skilfully upon very
tender ground, no other than in plain English saying that if the King
recovered it was only to a state of dotage, and that the loss of sight
and hearing disqualified a man, without even the loss of reason, from
fulfilling the functions of a sovereign.<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> The Ministers were not
in spirits, else they might have replied and done him great mischief
in the country. Ward, who is a <i>friend</i>, sneeringly observed
that the <i>Whig</i> earl would make few proselytes to the doctrine
deposing the Monarch. Ld. Grenville spoke, but, I was sorry to hear,
in a feeble, disorganised state. Ld. Moira took a line of his own in
favour of adjournt., affecting to speak the language of the P. Indeed,
with much affectation, he told Lds. Grey and Lansdowne that his speech
he was conscious was <i>bad</i>, but that was always the case when
a person spoke contrary to their own opinion; but he was compelled
by instructions from a quarter he was bound to obey, designating as
distinctly as possible the Prince. In the Commons Burdett provoked a
division, in which persons voted as they liked. Grey, Lauderdale, Ld.
Ponsonby, Jersey, and Tierney came here after the debate and dined. The
King is certainly worse, and the Ministers are puzzled.</p>

<p><i>27th Nov.</i>—Ld. Grenville quitted town the day after the
adjournt., <i>oppressed</i> by the recollection of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span> former
opinions delivered when Speaker; but since, whether the continued
illness of the King or other equally cogent reasons have convinced
him that he may relax, it seems he has written to Ld. Grey, to inform
him that upon reflection he does not feel the necessity so imperious
of urging these opinions, for tho’ he maintains the same principles,
yet expediency qualifies them at present. It is expected that the
summons for the convoking the Privy Council will be issued this evening
indiscriminately to all Councillors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AFFAIRS AT CADIZ</div>

<p>Mr. Adair, <i>alias</i> the melancholy Jaques, arrived here a few days
ago, and still continues our inmate in his way from Constantinople. He
stopped at Cadiz, and brings very interesting accounts of the first
meeting of the Cortes.<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> Arguelles, Capmany, Gallego, Torneros are
the leading speakers. I know very little upon these matters, but it
strikes me that they have been guilty of great impolicy in excluding
the Grandees from their body, as it must make them feel irritated
at the slight. Were I one of that class, shut up upon that dreary
causeway, my sole occupation would be to quit them and join any party
where my territorial influence would be considered; for these Grandees,
with scarce any exception, fled with the Patriots, and sacrificed their
<i>all</i> to what they considered was the <i>common cause</i>, but
which to their consternation and mortification they now find was only
the cause<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span> of a few; not to say that it would be some satisfaction
to assist in overthrowing the <i>patriotic Junta</i>, created upon
principles far different from the former practice when the Cortes used
in ancient times to be assembled. By this scheme of exclusion they
create in the heart of the little community a strong interest against
themselves. Formerly the <i>bravo Militar</i>, which was the nobility,
were an integral part of the Cortes; now they are not called. Mr.
Stuart, of Lisbon, and Ld. Wellington write home against them as having
a Jacobinical tendency, and being merely a <i>réchauffé</i> of the
French Revolution.</p>

<p>The latest Governt. accts. are to the 12th from the Tagus, Sr. Robt.
Wilson<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> <i>en debite</i> news of the 15th, with the story of Drouet
having joined with 15 <i>bataillons</i>, which makes about 9000 men.
Sr. Robt. is greatly and justly offended at having been dismissed
officially the Portuguese service; this naturally enough tinctures all
his opinions and disposes him to view <i>au noir</i> both Wellington’s
and Beresford’s campaign. The enemies of Wilson accuse him of having
taken great credit to himself for resistance in the <i>Puerto de
Baños</i> after the battle of Talavera, whereas Ld. W. has recently
discovered that he did nothing whatever there.<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> Also there is
another charge, which, if substantiated, is serious, but from his
general reputation is considered as highly improbable, viz., peculating
in his transactions about raising the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span> Lusitanian Legion. He is a very
active officer, and whatever blemishes he may have in rhodomontading, I
know from experience, having been in the country at the time, that when
every other English officer took to his heels, he alone remained, and
by setting a good face upon matters kept in check at Salamanca a French
corps of 6000 men, when he was in Ciudad Rodrigo with only a few half
dismounted cannon and some of his miserable Legion.</p>

<p>Bulletins bad; Ministers defer till the latest hour issuing the summons
of the Privy Council. Great failures at Liverpool. Huskisson’s pamphlet
upon the report of the Finance Committee, a very general topic of
conversation.<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> L., a little jealous, accuses him of stealing some
of his own best observations and disfiguring them for concealment.</p>

<p><i>28th.</i>—Hurrah! Huzza! A long and delightful letter from Charles,
and a copious journal of all that has occurred since he sailed from
Cadiz Bay, 7th August! He writes from Gibraltar Bay, 5th November,
then in quarantine on acct. of symptoms of fever. Inquires if the
ex-pigs are likely to have a little suck. Seems not so keen for Navy as
before; thank Heaven, if he should at the end of a year sicken of it!
<i>Oxala!</i></p>

<p>The Privy Council is called to-day for the examination of physicians.
Baillie remains at Windsor to attend the K. during the absence of the
others, but comes for examination to-morrow. Great rumours of adjournt.
being again intended.</p>

<p><i>29th, Thursday.</i>—Evidence of the medical men favourable as to
amendment, but nothing said as to the time for recovery.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PRINCE OF WALES’ CONDUCT</div>

<p><i>Dec. 6th.</i>—There has been a communication with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span> Prince;
the complection of the business is not very favourable. It seems
that in consequence of a trivial expression dropped accidentally
in a conversation Ld. Grey held with Mr. Tucker, the latter
gentleman conceived it to be sufficiently important to induce him to
<i>repeat</i> it to Col. McMahon<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> to report to the Prince. The
expression was that affairs were in that state that, ‘if the Prince
were to hold up his finger he would have every thing his own way.’</p>

<p>The Prince, who sees Adam frequently, had talked to him frankly enough
in general. One day during their conversation the Lord Chancellor
solicited an audience: the P. desired he might be admitted, and
at the same time begged Adam to wait, as he should soon close his
conference with the C. It was, however, of some duration, but when Adam
returned, he assured him the visit was merely one of form respecting
some circumstances connected with the Pss. Amelia’s will; that he had
listened and made no reply beyond a very formal bow. This might, or
might not be true; Adam had his doubts. The Prince then began saying
(which astonished Adam) that he had received a communication from Ld.
Grey, who implied that he had not taken part enough in the business
of the K.’s illness. That he might be right or wrong, but that he was
resolved upon remaining quiet; that he esteemed both Lords Grenville
and Grey, but could not see them; that if they wished to serve him they
ought to ask Ministers in Parlt. whether any official notification
had been made to the Prince of the condition in which H. Majesty was;
also that if he were compelled by circumstances to maintain them, yet
if they got into minorities by their mismanagement, he might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span> then be
enabled to follow his inclination and call them,—Opposition, to his
Council. He desired Adam to communicate this to Lds. Grenville, Grey,
and Mr. Ponsonby; Tommy Tyrwhitt also told Ld. Grenville. It was agreed
that a respectful answer should be conveyed to the Prince, couched in
all the usual proper terms; the substance, however, declining to adopt
any line of conduct expressed through a secret understanding, as it
would be doing exactly what they had so much deprecated during their
own Administration—that of the King ostensibly employing them, but,
at the same time, consulting with his secret advisers. Ld. Grenville
said that the position of affairs might be such that were the Prince to
consult him, he did not know but that he might recommend him to keep
the present Ministers; but having done that he must withdraw and act
upon his own principles until he was publicly called as an adviser. The
expression which put Ld. G. upon the alert was that of the possibility
of minorities, which he construed into a determined plan of Prince’s
betraying those he openly supported. Ld. Grey was compelled to leave
town on acct. of Ly. Grey’s lying-in.</p>

<p>Subsequent to this transaction, Adair, on the pretext of giving the
P. some curious anecdotes of his Embassy, solicited an audience, and
by dint of solicitation at length obtained one. In the course of the
interview, the P. launched out in his eloquent, rhodomontading manner,
abused the late Ministry (always excepting Ld. H., whom he professes so
much to love), whom he accused of treating him worse than his avowed
enemies. Added that he knew they now complained of his not sending for
them, but that he would be d—— if he did; they accused him of being
timid and nervous, but that by G—— they and the world should see that
he was <i>un homme de nerf</i>; that he would not be dictated to by
the haughty freaks and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span> caprices of any man; turned frequently to the
portrait of Mr. Fox, whose death was to him an irreparable loss, for he
really loved him, and in any critical juncture his advice was always
that of a sincere friend who was blessed with the soundest head man
ever possessed; abused the late Cabinet for their treatment of him in
the affair of the Princess, and, in short, spoke with all the vehemence
and irritation of an offended and wounded mind.</p>

<p><i>7th Dec., 1810.</i>—The bulletin yesterday was less favourable, and
that of to-day is indifferent; admits that the disorder had returned,
but that some hours of sleep had refreshed him. By the private acct. it
seems that his bodily indisposition is rather alarming, a recurrence
of the stoppage in his bowels; his body is greatly emaciated. Phipps,
the expert oculist but very silly man, has been prevented by Willis’s
orders from seeing him, as he was detected in talking upon religious
matters, future state, dying, &amp;c., &amp;c. The report yesterday was that
Ministers, if by the King’s relapsing they should be compelled to
resort to some mode of Regency, intended to have that of the <i>Lords
Justices</i>. To-day Mr. Grenville told me that the scheme was to make
the Queen Regent. All these schemes will perplex and frighten the
Prince, and drive him to resort to his friends. Ld. H. saw McMahon, who
declares that Ld. Moira and Sheridan, who are affecting to speak the
language and sentiments of C. House, on the contrary, have displeased
the Prince, whom they do not see and whom they have not had any
authority whatever from to act as they do. Whilst the P. is in town
he sees no person whatever but Lady Hertford, with whom he spends the
whole morning and evening. Mr. Michael Angelo Taylor he sees as a butt,
but with him he holds no sort of intercourse respecting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span> his political
opinions. They say Govt. has money for 10 days longer.</p>

<p><i>15th Dec.</i>—On Thursday the Houses met; the K.’s health not being
in a state for the physicians to report upon with any hope of immediate
recovery, Ministers did not suggest an adjournt., but proposed a
Committee for the purpose of examining the physicians. The choice of
persons in Commons was very fair, in the Lords less so, as neither
Lds. Lauderdale, Holland, or Stanhope are named, which, considering
the absence of Ld. Grey, is not so right.<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> Except Ld. Erskine and
the D. of Norfolk, there is not a man who will ask a leading question,
and these will be overruled. The Prince broke down in Kensington on
his way to Windsor. When Ld. Grenville heard of it he affected to be
facetious, and wondered the Princess did not offer him a bed; true it
was the Prince was excessively afraid of her offering him a carriage,
which she certainly would have done had she known of it at the moment.
The projects of raising money by the Privy Seal, &amp;c., are dropped.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE GOVERNMENT RESOLUTIONS</div>

<p><i>18th Dec.</i>—It appears from the examination of the physicians
that the King’s illness is such that a Regency must be resorted to
immediately; consequently yesterday Mr. Perceval proposed 3 resolutions
the same as those in 1788. 1st, that on account of H. M. indisposition
he was unable to discharge the duties of the kingly office. 2ndly,
that it was the duty of the House to see that the kingly office be
properly filled. 3rdly, that it was necessary to provide for the proper
discharge of the same by way of a Bill to pass through both Houses of
Parlt. Sheridan, Ponsonby, and Adam have thrown down the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span> gauntlet and
taken the field; the Prince’s household will vote. There is a Call
of the House, and now the Prince takes a part there will be a very
good division. Some of the most sanguine go the length of expecting
a majority; there is no doubt but many shabby ones will desert the
Ministers. The usual supply of those upon these occasions from the City
will fail on acct. of the report of the Bullion Committee, as they
will prefer taking their chance of keeping Perceval Chancellor of the
Exchequer to making the Bank pay in specie.<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></p>

<p>It was not with any satisfaction I heard of a few additional votes
by the accession of Mr. Canning and his friends upon this question.
Majorities, even if helped by a faithless associate, are mere ropes
of sand. Faithless and unprincipled are the leading traits in that
gentleman’s character. It is said that he complains of having met
with so little warmth from the Opposition, with whom he would have
acted long ago had he been encouraged. The greediness for numbers
makes me dread his reception; all who dislike Whitbread, and that is
a huge majority, and all who feel the incapacity of <i>Snouch</i>,
are inclined to hearken to his overtures. Ld. Castlereagh, though
labouring under many heavy charges for his conduct towards the Irish
Catholics, has still maintained a sort of integrity of reputation for
private honour; he also has the advantage of being a person whom the
Prince would prefer if any junction were to be made with new men, and
his ambition is of a limited nature, as he would confine himself to
his department and only promote persons either from goodwill towards
them, or for the general advantage of the Administration to which he
belonged. He makes no high professions of exalted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span> principle, but as a
gentleman and man of honour he might be trusted. In the late curious
quarrel between him and Mr. Canning, his conduct was much admired, and
his bitterest enemies said how infamously must he have been treated by
his colleague, when even in Ireland he is considered as the injured
party.</p>

<p>Several questions in the Committee were expunged. In that of the Lords
the word <i>mind</i> was employed, when Ld. Westmorland, with an air
of the greatest feeling and pathos, implored that it might be erased,
as it was too shocking to have on record: this great delicacy <i>from
him</i>, who is at this moment dictating evidence to enable him to
confine his own wife, in order to avoid the expense of a separate
maintenance. Sheridan laughed at the conduct in the examination of the
physicians, where he said they questioned the physicians about the
mental malady and the mad doctor upon the bodily disease. It appeared
that the Chancellor was introduced to the K. by way of a <i>medical
expedient</i> by Vaughan, who had observed that in his presence the
King had more <i>self command</i>. In consequence of this transpiring,
the Chancellor, in their Committee, conceived himself bound to go the
whole length of the business to acquit himself of seeking the interview
with the King.</p>

<p>MacMahon says the Regency is to be accepted on any conditions by the
Prince, who will return the same letter by way of answer, as that he
sent in ’88 (said letter, Mr. Adam says, was written by Lord Minto,
materials from Mr. Fox); that he may probably tell these Ministers that
it is his intention to keep them for decency sake, but that he has no
confidence whatever in them, and cannot feel that he is fulfilling his
duty. In short, if they do not, which he expects they will, resign
upon this intimation, he will keep them a month to give the King a
chance of recovery, and then dismiss them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span> The Queen will have the
custody and control of the King’s person and household, and to set off
with, she can appoint the Chamberlain, now vacant by the death of Lord
Dartmouth.<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE KING OF SWEDEN</div>

<p>The King of Sweden<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> lives chiefly with the French Princes, and now
occupies the apartment vacant by the death of the Queen of France. He
is <i>très in-amusable</i>, very much absorbed in his own thoughts,
and indifferent to all that is going on around him. He has very little
money, but will not accept of any from the English; 500<i>l.</i> and
jewels estimated at 30,000<i>l.</i> on the Continent are all he is
worth. When lodged at the hotel, he asked for an inferior apartment to
that which was prepared for his reception, and accused the master of
imposing upon him by charging for a whole bottle of wine, when he had
only drunk about half of it and returned the remainder. He does not
speak of the Swedes with any irritation, allows they were in the right
for dismissing him as he did not suit them, resolves not to attempt to
be restored, and only hopes his moderation may induce them hereafter to
consider his son. This is not madness certainly, but nevertheless he is
reckoned to be in a state of melancholy madness. Lucien Bonaparte is
arrived,<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> but he is not to be allowed to come to London; Ludlow is
named as his place of residence.</p>

<p><i>24th Dec.</i>—On Thursday, the day of the debate in the H. of
Commons upon the resolutions, the Prince<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span> received a letter from
Mr. Perceval informing him of the intentions of the Ministry. To
this the Princes wrote what they call a solemn protest of the male
branches of the Royal family, disapproving of the limitations and
restrictions. Prince also wrote a good reply, which was the composition
of himself and Sheridan. War between Perceval and the Prince being
openly declared, all the household, &amp;c., of Carlton House voted. This,
however, produced no great accession of <i>rats</i>, only the Seymours
and Mr. Monkton. The Grenvilles being disunited upon the subject may
acct. for the badness of the division. Mr. Horner made an admirable
speech, full of sound argument upon constitutional doctrines, and
illustrated with most accurate learning. Tierney says he gave the
House for two hours two quarts of Allen’s milk without their making
a wry face; alluding to S. Smith’s joke that Mr. A. is quite a milch
cow to the politicians, whom he furnishes with matter and argument,
and has in this business done so abundantly to those who are studying
the subject. Mr. Canning made but a bad attempt at pleasantry. Ld.
Castlereagh, speaking of the conduct of Addington’s Administration
during the K.’s illness, said he believed that Governt. <i>did not
practise any concealments towards him</i>, or something to that effect.
The House immediately applied it as a slap to Mr. Canning. Others
say it was a mere slip of the tongue. Wm. Lamb on the following day
distinguished himself very greatly; he is certainly one of the most
rising men in public. The great feature of that night’s proceeding was
Perceval’s indiscreet avowal of his principles of delay and Ministerial
Regency (without limitations), from which Tom Grenville remarks that as
Perceval has now declared himself King, Lords, and Commons upon his own
<i>responsibility</i>, the whole question is shortened and made much
less complicated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DUKE OF QUEENSBERRY’S DEATH</div>

<p>The D. of Queensberry died to-day without a struggle at three o’clock;
his will has not yet been opened.<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> His heirs-at-law are the D. of
Buccleugh, Sr. Chas. Douglas, Lord Wemyss.<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> He expressed a wish of
altering his will yesterday, but was too rambling. He said he had been
a fool in leaving legacies, for in fact all belonged to Bonaparte, and
any distribution was idle. He has always said and believed in this.</p>

<p>On Sunday, 6th Jan., the Prince sent to see Ld. Grenville, who
accordingly waited upon him at Carlton House; the communication was
made through Mr. Adam. Prince, when he came, desired this might be
considered as a joint application to him, as well as to Ld. Grey, who
unfortunately was not arrived in town. The immediate object of the
interview was to have advice how to frame the answer to the deputation
which was coming from the two Houses, to offer the Regency. He then
told Ld. G. that he felt his situation very embarrassing, that it would
be difficult to act in any way to please people, or make a strong
Government. That he heard from those who were in the H. of C. that the
great difficulties rested there, that he wished Ld. G. to understand
that he was against exclusions, and if it were judged expedient to
resort to additional strength, meaning Canning, he had, whatever his
own opinions respecting him individually were, no objections to the
experiment. He said there was also another topic which he had at heart,
the restoring his brother to be Commander-inChief.<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span> Ld. G. replied
that he should bear in mind all H.R.H. had said, and consult with his
friends upon the subject, but that he thought it an act of duty without
any hesitation to state that the obstacles to the restoration of the
D. of York were insurmountable; that they existed amongst those most
attached to the Whig Party; that he himself deplored the injustice
of persons upon that subject, and, if he might venture to use such
an expression, to so exalted a character. He added that he felt the
greatest <i>compassion</i> for the Duke, who had been so cruelly
misrepresented and slandered. The Prince bid him communicate with Ld.
Moira and his other friends. Adam told this on the day of the interview.</p>

<p>Ld. Grenville made a formal communication to politicians at his own
house on the following Tuesday. Ld. H. had a private conversation with
him in which he stated his own opinions upon the necessity, if they
formed a Governt., of considering maturely the question of Spain and
Portugal with regard to withdrawing the troops, &amp;c.; also of the state
of the press, which was under Ld. Ellenboro’ greatly harassed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">QUESTION OF REGENCY</div>

<p>On Wednesday night Ld. Grey arrived in town; he came here in evening,
appointed on the ensuing day to go to Carlton House. Prince very
gracious, cordial, and more communicative than with Ld. Grenville. Upon
mention of additional strength in House of Commons, Grey remonstrated
upon the fallacy of strength being obtained by the accession alluded
to (Canning), where sturdy old friends would be lost entirely. Prince
observed the clamour excited by Grenville’s resistance as Auditor
to the issuing money from the Exchequer, conceived it fatal to his
being attached to the Treasury; folly of his letter to Perceval. They
separated most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span> amicably. Ld. Grey went directly to frame a reply for
P. to the deputation which was next day to offer, from the two Houses,
the Regency. Informed the Prince, if their paper did not meet his
wishes, that he dined at Ld. Holland’s in Pall Mall, where he should
remain to receive H.R.H. commands. We had only Ld. Thanet and Tierney,
Ld. H. confined by the gout. At twelve at night, Adam, accompanied by
Sheridan, came from C. H., bearing a message from the P., which in
plain language was a total rejection of the paper drawn up by Lds.
Grey and Grenville, and sending them another, the joint composition
of himself and S. Ld. Grey with great moderation and temper declined
giving any opinion upon the subject, his own being rejected; said they
could not be responsible for sentiments they had not written. Sheridan,
who had thrust himself into the whole transaction, protested against
their responsibility, alleging that the Prince was not himself in a
condition to invest persons with responsibility, that he had drawn a
paper, and Ld. Moira had done the same. After Ld. Grey went away, such
a scene of duplicity and jealousy was exhibited by S. beyond all belief
or description; it required all Adam’s forbearance and good temper to
prevent great asperity in the discussion. Ld. H. contended for the
responsibility, considering the sending for these Lords as an open act
similar to that of a King upon his accession employing a certain set
of persons to answer the address from the Privy Council, as his future
Ministers.</p>

<p>They went off to C. H. at two o’clock. By Adam’s report, S.’s
description of what had passed here was a most gross misrepresentation,
and a malicious interpretation of every word uttered. They all parted
in wrath; the P. determining to keep what S. made him believe was his
own, whereas in fact it was S.’s. This is one of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span> artifices by
which he ensnares the P., first suggesting ideas and words, which he
dexterously contrives to make the P. believe are his own. (He avowed
this to us some months ago.<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a>) Some of Sheridan’s phrases were
very bad. The Prince was to say in a taunting manner that he hoped
the authority he was to be invested with would be as <i>brief</i>
as it was <i>restricted</i>, showing a silly soreness towards the
Parliament. On Friday the deputation came; and the paper composed by S.
and the Prince was delivered. Grey and Grenville upon the rejection of
their paper drew up a remonstrance glancing at secret advisers, which
they delivered to Adam to give to the Prince. In the meantime the P.
expressed a wish to explain to Ld. H. the whole transaction, and fixed
calling upon him on Saturday. By a mistake of Ld. Moira’s, Ld. H.
waited for him, as he ought to have told him that the P. could not come
till this day, Sunday, 13th Jan., 1811, Pall Mall.</p>

<p>The interview was long; only Mr. Adam present. Authorised an
explanation to the two Lords, that he did not conceive his application
to them could as <i>yet</i> be considered as official. Consequently
they were not in any responsible situation; that they proceeded upon a
misconception.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GRENVILLE’S AUDITORSHIP</div>

<p><i>Sunday, 20th.</i>—A very <i>stormy</i> week, but down to this
evening the political horizon brightens. When the two Lords began
to discuss arrangements the difficulties seemed insurmountable. Ld.
Grey reminded Lord Grenville of the conversation they had formerly
had together upon the subject of the impossibility of his holding his
place of Auditor of the Exchequer with that of the First Ld. of the
Treasury. Ld. Grenville alleged <i>poverty</i>, proposed that Tom,<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a>
who <i>par parenthèse</i>, has been voluntarily out of Parlt. these
three years, should have the Admiralty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span> and the first peerage. Upon
the obstacle of the Auditorship being strongly re-argued, a singular
paper was delivered in to Grey, in which statements were made of
the condition of the First Lords for the preceding 40 years, all of
whom had enjoyed large places with the Treasury; stating his own
difficulties of undertaking such an expensive station with the mere
addition of 1000<i>l.</i> pr. ann.; that he should be overwhelmed with
debt. That he could not consent to take the Home Department without
an express and distinct understanding that <i>all</i> the Patronage
of <i>Church</i> and <i>State</i> which had hitherto gone through the
First Ld. of Treasury, should be annexed to the Home Department. That
the Minutes of Cabinet should be drawn up by Ld. G. and laid before the
Regent or King; that he could not yield his pre-eminence; and rather
an arrogant and flourishing termination. The whole composition evinced
a sordid and low mind. Scarcely had it been sent, before Ld. Auckland
was dispatched to recover it. Ld. Grey hesitated, because if a rupture
became inevitable, it was such a complete acquittal of himself.</p>

<p>By-the-bye, I forgot to mention that the <i>first</i> hitch arose from
a proposal on the part of Lord Grenville that, from the state of the
H. of Commons they ought to look about them for <i>strength</i>, that
the lists were not satisfactory, and that they could not be sure of
majorities. The plain English of this was that they wanted an organ
of their own, Canning for instance, as a barrier against the popular
principles of the Whigs and the unpopular and odious manners of
Whitbread, whom unfortunately all parties concur in hating, however
they may respect him as a public character. Ld. Grey replied that upon
consulting his own friends, he was satisfied that the numbers were
such as to enable a Govt, to go on well, that by taking Mr. C. weight
would be lost,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span> not gained; for the gain would be 10 votes, and the
loss of three times that number of real, staunch friends. That upon
the mere report of such a junction already Mr. Coke declared his first
vote under the new Governt. should be against them, if Mr. C. composed
one of the Govt.; also that Messrs. Byng, Brand, &amp;c., were of the same
opinion, Ld. J. Cavendish, and most of the old Foxites.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WHIG DISUNION</div>

<p>Ld. Grenville seemed thunderstruck at Grey’s urging that if a motion
was made by the enemy against the union of the offices of Treasurer
and Auditor, it would be impossible to prevent many of their own
friends from voting against them. In the evening Ld. G. wrote to Grey
to say that the point in discussion could not be canvassed by them in
conversation. Proposed by Grey that Ld. Spencer should be First Lord
of Treasury; Grenvilles all eager to declare that he had entirely
withdrawn from public life. Various other modes suggested, such as
Ld. Grenville’s placing the Auditorship in trust and not receiving
the salary whilst he enjoyed the Treasury. On the 16th matters seemed
in a state of complete disunion, and the differences between the
two Lords began to be talked of in public. In stating the friends
with whom Ld. Grenville said he should consult before he came to a
final determination, he mentioned Lords Stafford and Carrington. He
now talked of giving up all idea of forming an Administration, and
recommending the Prince to keep the present Ministers; but Ld. Grey
will not agree, as in his opinion it is a scandalous desertion of the
Prince. Tom Grenville has begged Grey not to be offended at any dryness
and formality in the style of Ld. Grenville’s letters, as official
habits early in life make all he writes upon topics of business seem as
dry as a chip. In conversation it had been thrown out that the Treasury
stripped and degraded would not be fit for Ld. Grey to accept, but
that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span> George Ponsonby or Lord Lansdowne might do the duties of it; but
this was not listened to, it being impossible, notwithstanding all Lord
Grenville said of the present salary, patronage, and influence of the
Treasury being a usurpation upon the patronage of the Home Department,
to consent to such a glaring alteration as to reduce that which had
been hitherto considered as the first office in the State to as low
a condition even as a mere Lord of the Treasury. From Lord Temple’s
language, which is violent and indiscreet, and from Tom’s, which tho’
milder and more guarded betrays much soreness, it is clear that it
is not the numbers of the H. of Commons which induced them to urge a
junction with Mr. Canning, but that they felt they had no man of their
<i>own</i>, and could not submit to be represented by such persons as
Whitbread, &amp;c.</p>

<p>However, at present (21st) all stands well again. On 18th Ld. Grenville
with great good humour has given up his schemes of advancement (?), and
is content to take the Treasury, yielding all the other offices to Ld.
Grey’s nomination, excepting the Secretary at War for Ld. Temple, and
the Board of Control, with a seat in Cabinet!! for Ld. Auckland; and
with respect to the Auditorship, he offered to put it into trust, but
could not afford to give up the salary, and all he required was that
Whitbread should acquiesce in the arrangement and defend it, were it
to be attacked in Parlt. This proposal was submitted to Whitbread, and
strongly urged by Lds. Grey and Holland, but he could not be brought to
agree, tho’ he acknowledged that in principle he had no objection to
the Auditorship being vested in trust whilst Ld. G. held the Treasury.
He admitted that so far from thinking that 4000<i>l.</i> a year was
too great an addition to the present salary of the Treasury, that he
was ready to propose in the House of Commons that the salary of that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
and of every high office should be raised to 10,000<i>l.</i> pr. ann.,
but he could not defend his holding the two offices. He grounds his
objection upon a foolish piece of personal vanity, having last year
demanded, in an imperative tone, of Perceval whether Yorke received his
salary of Teller of Exchequer during his enjoyment of the emoluments
of First Lord of Admiralty, and having, as he thought, intimidated
them from it as he was answered in the negative, he could not bring
himself to defend what he had by his tone reprobated in public. He
was very obstinate in his manner, and gave a specimen of his want of
conciliating disposition for hereafter, tho’ in this instance he was
not so much in the wrong, as he had been assured in the beginning of
the arrangements that Ld. G. would give it up. Whitbread continued
inflexible, and on the 19th Ld. Grey wrote a very handsome letter to
Lord Grenville’s proposal, in which he stated Whitbread’s unwillingness
to defend the measure, expressing his own sincere regret at W.’s
resolution, adding that he could not bring himself to act with Mr.
Canning, and therefore nothing remained for him but to abandon all
thoughts of taking part in the Govt., leaving Ld. G. at liberty to
form whatever Administration he chose, which he was ready to engage he
should not oppose, tho’ he could not assist. Ld. Grenville was hurt at
Whitbread’s conduct. On 20th, in morning, Ld. Grenville consented to
give up the salary of Auditor during his being at the head of Treasury.
They were to go on the following day to the Prince, which is the day
appointed for their answer.</p>

<p><i>21st Jan.</i>—The paper they delivered to the Prince was to
inform him that they were ready to undertake the Govt., but advising
him before he undertakes the Regency to institute an examination of
physicians as to the state of the King’s health, and if the result
should be that it is probable that the King would be so far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span> recovered
within any limited time so as to be able to resume the exercise of
the royal functions, in that case they advise him not to change the
Ministers, giving them such an explanation of his motives for retaining
them as would prevent him from being justly considered as approving,
much less as adopting, the system of their policy. The whole was a very
vague, loose way of expressing themselves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE QUEEN’S LETTER</div>

<p>On Tuesday the Prince sent for them again, and showed a letter he
had received from the Queen (Mr. Adam would not allow me to take a
copy). ‘My dearest son, you will be, I am sure, highly gratified to
hear that the King is considerably improved in health; he had an
interview this morning with Mr. Perceval, who was much satisfied with
his whole appearance. He held a very reasonable conversation, and
inquired with great interest all that had been done, and expressed
himself with kindness towards you, and said he was pleased with yr.
conduct <i>pending this business</i>. I send my own servant that there
may be no delay in yr. receiving this agreeable information. (Signed)
Charlotte,’</p>

<p>The Prince ridiculed the artifice, which was too gross to escape
detection. What woman, he said, ever used the Westminster Hall term
of <i>pending the business</i>? They thought him shook and little
disposed to encounter the clamour of a change. He showed them a letter
from Perceval in which he represented the state of public business as
pressing. The Prince begged them to write the answer, which was done
offhand.</p>

<p>On withdrawing they agreed to assemble a meeting of their future
Cabinet to take the business into consideration, and on Thursday,
31st Jan., they met both morning and evening. It was agreed that they
should, in consequence of the representation in Perceval’s letter of
the state of the army and navy and the progress of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span> private Bills
(which he artfully had pressed on), communicate to the Prince that it
would be subjecting the country to very material injury if he delayed
48 hours longer the bringing his mind to a determination, either of
changing the Ministry, or retaining those now in their offices. In the
meantime Sr. Henry Halford (Dr. Vaughan), who had been suspected of
meddling more with the body politic than with the diseased physical
body he was called in to attend, had frequent audiences of the Prince,
in which he worked upon his imagination and fears by drawing the
picture of the King agitated and thrown into an exa—tion [<i>sic</i>]
which might end fatally; their removing his confidential servants would
inevitably produce that effect. It is also suspected that he added if
the King recovered and found things stationary he would not reassume
the authority, and that the Prince might continue in power. There
are besides a hundred little anecdotes, which by not writing at the
time have escaped my memory. There was also a letter from the D. of
Cumberland, who said, ‘<i>Vaughan has behaved nobly to us all</i>.’</p>

<p>The Prince was very much agitated, and on Friday he saw Adam, Lds.
Moira and Hutchinson, to whom he stated the distracted state of his
mind, and bid them do justice to his feelings. In the evening he sent
Adam and Ld. Hutchinson to Camelford House, by appointment to Lds. G.
and G., intimating that in consequence of the report of the physicians
as to the probable recovery of the King, he had resolved not to remove
the Ministers, hoped they approved, thanked them for their generous
conduct, and begged to see them on the following Sunday, and also Ld.
Holland, Mr. G. Ponsonby.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AFFAIRS IN SICILY</div>

<p><i>October, 1811.</i>—Sudden return of Ld. Wm. Bentinck<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span> from
Sicily for further instructions, after an absence of only a few weeks,
has surprised people, and convinced them of his want of capacity and
timidity of character. It is understood that his instructions were
merely an echo of those given to his predecessor, Lord Amherst, the
substance of which was to induce the Court by moderate means to admit
the native Sicilians into the Governt., and to diminish the burthens
upon the people, and various other points of importance. Ld. Wm. is
accused of having very unskilfully in his first paper to Circello
betrayed the whole context of his secret instructions; whereupon
its not appearing that Ld. Wm. had the power of withholding the
subsidy Circello made a most able diplomatic reply, deprecating the
interference of any foreign power, however allied, with the internal
Governt., and giving it plainly to be understood that <i>allies</i>
who acted thus might withdraw their forces. Upon the receipt of this,
Ld. Wm., without further discussion, got on board the first vessel,
which happened to be Capt. Clifford, of the <i>Cephalus</i>, gun brig,
and came home. It is said Ministers were astonished, but declared
everywhere that they were highly pleased at his conduct. As that is
<i>impossible</i>, the glossing it over must be out of compliment to
the D. of Portland. The report is that the Cabinet have resolved upon
vigorous measures, and those who know the Queen believe she will not
resist, but in case of her being so disposed, she is to be made to
submit, and a retreat into Austria suggested as her best<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span> resource.
The unfortunate Barons who were imprisoned in consequence of their
appeal,<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> are left in severe confinement, and Prince Belmonte, who
is in a precarious state of health, will certainly not survive the
confinement in one of the worst dungeons, and in the most unwholesome
spot in the Island. The idle English, by their silly language in the
coffee houses have contributed much towards irritating the Queen.
Fredk. Lamb<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> is at last to accompany Ld. Wm.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COMMISSION TO MEXICO</div>

<p>The Commissioners to Mexico are to begin their peregrinations in about
3 weeks; it is a trading voyage. Capt. Cockburn,<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> who is one and
is to have the rank of Commodore and a flag, goes first to Lisbon
to pick up Mr. Stewart; then to Cadiz for the Spaniards; to Jamaica
for Mr. Morier; and finally to Vera Cruz. From what is said, the
expedition seems to be rather a wild goose chase. It is not certain
that the Spanish Governt. will accept the offered mediation. When it
was originally proposed, they accepted, annexing the condition that
if the colonies did not within 15 months fall into their allegiance
to the Mother Country, that in that case the English should assist
with military force and compel them to submit by subduing them. This
condition has not been acceded to on the part of this Governt.,
but they send out this Commission, without waiting for the final
determination of the Govt. of Cadiz, now they know that they are
only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span> to be supported in any pacific measures. The man upon whom much
depends is Bardachi, a sort of Secretary of State, who, with some
abilities and honesty, is full of prejudice against this country, and
of an impracticable temper. B. Hoppner is Sec. to the Commission.
Frere, who has been living here upwards of a month, to my astonishment
expressed himself surprised and offended that he had been neglected by
Ld. Wellesley, saying that from his knowledge of Spain he considered
himself as the fittest to be employed; boasted of his influence
over Bardachi, who owes his place to him, and various other such
<i>absurdities</i>. I was petrified, it not being possible to acquiesce
in the reasonableness of his complaint, or consider it as an injury the
not selecting him.</p>

        <div>A tribute to this happy day.</div>
      </div>

<p>Thirty-six years afterwards, on March 25, 1831, Lord Holland gave his
wife another copy of verses, and the reader will probably be interested
in seeing a short selection from them.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX B</h3>
</div>


<p>The following letters from Mr. Campbell to Lord Holland, referring
to the first meeting of the Cortes at Cadiz, have been considered of
sufficient interest for publication.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Mr. R. Campbell to Lord Holland.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="r2">Cadiz, Sept. 26th, 1810.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,—I am just returned from the Isle of Leon
where I had been to witness the opening of the Cortes, and
am favoured with your Lordship’s letter of the 6th inst;
the packet has orders to sail immediately upon receiving
Mr. Wellesley’s despatches, which I am informed will be
ready in less than an hour, so that I have only time to
give your Lordship a very short and imperfect account of
what has hitherto passed in the Cortes; such, however, as
it is, I have no doubt but it will be interesting to your
Lordship.</p>

<p>The Cortes met, agreeably to the summons of convocation, in
the Isle of Leon, on the 24th inst, and having taken the
usual oaths, administered to them in an adjoining church
by the Bishop of Orense, President of the Regency, they
repaired in a Body to the <i>Theatre</i> which had been
fitted up for their reception, as the most convenient for
<i>them</i> and the best adapted for the accommodation of
the <i>public</i> of any place that could be selected in
the Island. They were accompanied by a great concourse
of people of all ranks, shouting, ‘Viva España, viva la
nacion, y vivan los Padres de la Patria.’ After they were
installed, the Regency who had accompanied them gave an
account of their administration and made a formal demission
of their authority in the hands of the Cortes, and then
withdrew.</p>

<p>I was not present during the whole of the sitting, which
continued till 5 <i>o’clock</i> in the morning, but the
following is, I believe, a pretty correct account of the
most important Decrees which were passed, some of which you
will allow to be of <i>great importance indeed</i>, viz.:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span></p>

<p>The <i>sovereignty</i> of the nation, now assembled
in Cortes. The legislative power vested in them. The
inviolability of the persons of the deputies. All the
cessions made in Bayonne declared to be null and void, not
only on account of the violence employed in obtaining them,
but <i>chiefly</i> for having been made without the consent
and contrary to the will of the Spanish nation so strongly
pronounced. Ferdinand VII. declared to be King of Spain and
the Indies. (The motion was, King and <i>Sovereign</i>, but
the word <i>Sovereign</i> was rejected.)</p>

<p>The late Regency, for the present (<i>interinamente</i>)
to exercise the executive power; they and the Ministers
to be responsible to the Cortes for their conduct in the
administration of public affairs and to grant no offices
which were not absolutely and indispensably necessary in
the actual circumstances of the nation.</p>

<p>The Regency to take the usual oaths to the Cortes (which
they did on the same evening).</p>

<p>The Regency not to remove more than one league from the
place where the Cortes shall be sitting.</p>

<p>All officers, civil, military, and judiciary, confirmed in
their appointments. The judiciary to confine themselves
<i>strictly</i> to their <i>judicial</i> capacities.</p>

<p>Everything was conducted with a greater degree of
decorum than could have been expected, all circumstances
considered. Your Lordship will be of opinion that it was
a spectacle highly interesting to see a body of men thus
suddenly assembled and unaccustomed to public business,
discussing objects of the greatest magnitude with calmness
and dignity and with as much confidence that they were
laying the foundations of the independence, liberty,
and happiness of their country as if there was not a
Frenchman on this side of the Pyrenees, tho’ they were then
deliberating with a French army in sight and almost within
reach of their batteries.</p>

<p>I have the strongest hopes that the meeting of the Cortes
will produce the most favourable effects. It cannot fail
to rouse every dormant energy of the nation; <i>here</i>
the enthusiasm is universal, and I am not afraid of
its running into any of those horrible excesses which
disgraced the French Revolution. The elections have fallen
upon persons distinguished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span> for talents, probity, and
patriotism; this I know to be the case with respect to
those deputies which have been chosen here, and I have
reason to believe that it is <i>generally</i> so. There is
but one Grandee in the Cortes—Villafranca—who was chosen
by the <i>Ayuntamiento</i> of Murcia. Infantado would have
been chosen by the Emigrants from Madrid here. He had the
greatest number of suffrages; but being only one of three,
who were balloted for agreeably to the mode of election
prescribed by the enclosed paper, the lot fell upon a
<i>Relator</i> of the Council of Castile, a very able and
upright lawyer.</p>

<p>A commission, or rather committee, was appointed yesterday
to draw up a plan of the forms by which their future
proceedings were to be regulated. We expect that a decree
will be passed in a few days establishing the liberty of
the press; the plan of it, I have reason to think, is
now preparing. We expect likewise that a journal of the
proceedings and debates of the Cortes will be published
daily, and this, I hope, will be circulated, in thousands,
all over the country occupied by the enemy, by means of the
<i>guerrillas</i> which are every day increasing in number,
force, and audacity. I saw yesterday a respectable person
who was in Madrid when the <i>Empecinado</i> attacked
the <i>Casa de campo</i>, and when Joseph and his suite
fled in confusion and dismay from the playhouse. Very few
of the French cabinet couriers escape the vigilance and
boldness of the <i>guerrillas</i>. Another intercepted mail
has just arrived here containing correspondence of a very
interesting nature; it will be soon published.</p>

<p>The Cortes will probably remove their sittings in a short
time to Cadiz, where they will assemble in the church of
St. Phelipe Neri, the place in Cadiz best adapted for
the purpose. As it is not a parish church it will be
ceded without difficulty by the confraternity to which it
belongs. Your Lordship may remember that it is a handsome
<i>rotundo</i> of modern architecture, with capacious
galleries. Above the altar of the principal chapel there
is a celebrated ‘Conception’ of <i>Murillo</i>; I mention
this circumstance to assist your memory in recollecting the
place.</p>

<p>I enclose a very well written address to the deputies of
the Cortes which was published here three days before they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
met; the author, tho’ the initials of the name were not
subjoined, your Lordship would readily know to be Quintana.
He has not been elected for the Cortes. Capmany is one of
the deputies for Catalonia.</p>

<p>The last decree of the <i>Junta Central</i> which you
had the goodness to send me was not suppressed by their
successors; it was circulated here in manuscript. I read
it a few days after it was passed: it was not printed and
published, but its not being so did not, in my opinion,
arise from any improper motive. The truth is that the
<i>Junta Central</i> were and still are held in such
universal abhorrence that anything coming from them, were
it ever so good in itself, would have been ill received
by the public. The only member of that body to whom no
public odium has attached is your friend Jovellanos. He
has retired to some corner in Asturias; it was reported
some weeks ago that he had been named deputy to the Cortes
from some parts of that province, and the intelligence gave
great and general satisfaction. Garay and a few others
are still here, but seldom appear in public. Valdes is in
Gibraltar. Tilly and Calvo close prisoners in the Castle of
St. Sebastian. Villel in Catalonia, and the rest I know not
where. Riquelme, who, to avoid the effects of the popular
indignation, had taken refuge on board a Spanish frigate
commanded by Dn. Raphael Lobo, was the only person killed
by the fire of the French batteries on the Trocadero when
the frigate, having been driven from her anchors during
a violent storm, grounded within reach of the French
batteries and was at last set on fire by red hot shot.</p>

<p>I enclose a number of the <i>Conciso</i> (a new paper
published here) which has just come from the press; the
account which it gives of the proceedings in the Cortes
differs very little from what I have written above.</p>

<p>The assembly of the Cortes, tho’ late, is a most fortunate
circumstance; it affords the only hope of saving the
nation. The single circumstance of the Regency having been
appointed by the <i>Junta Central</i>, would for ever have
prevented them from obtaining the confidence of the public.</p>

<p>I beg to offer my best respects to Lady Holland and Mr.
Allen, and have the honour to be, &amp;c.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">R. Campbell</span>.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span></p>

<p>P.S.—Though the Cortes in a body are to have the
<i>tratamiento of Majesty</i>, the individual members are
to have no <i>tratamiento</i> nor any badge of distinction
as members of Cortes. When the Regency took the oaths
to the Cortes on the evening of the 24th, the Bishop of
Orense did not come, saying he was fatigued and much
indisposed, and he has since declined to take the oaths
from some <i>scruple of conscience</i>, of what nature we
do not know. The Cortes were sitting yesterday in a secret
committee of the whole, deliberating upon a communication
from the Regency.</p>
</div>


<p class="center"><i>Mr. R. Campbell to Lord Holland.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="r2">Cadiz, Dec. 10, 1810.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,—Being much hurried at present I must
refer your Lordship to the public reports for an account
of the further proceedings of the Cortes and of the events
which have lately taken place in this country. I shall
only say in general that we are still full of confidence.
A measure, which I have taken the liberty of strongly
recommending to some of my friends among the deputies, will
probably be moved in the Cortes this day or to-morrow. It
is to pass a decree making it a fundamental law of the
state that any King of Spain or Prince of the blood royal
who shall marry a <i>foreigner</i> without the consent
of the Cortes, shall by that act forfeit his title to
the crown. The subject of this decree, independent of
its general policy, is immediately to anticipate any new
trick or stratagem which Bonaparte may probably devise,
should the campaign in Portugal prove, as we hope,
signally disastrous to his arms, by marrying Ferdinand to
a Frenchwoman or an Austrian, and bringing him to Spain as
King, in order to create new factions and disunion. This
law will probably be proposed by Arguelles, and I have
little doubt will pass.</p>

<p>Your Lordship will perceive from this that we are at
present more afraid of the artifices than of the arms of
Napoleon.</p>

<p>Some discussion will likewise soon take place in the
Cortes with respect to the assumption of the title of
<i>Majesty</i></p>

<p>by them; a measure which, I was aware, would be liable
to much misconstruction in England. I shall write your
Lordship more fully on this and some other subjects by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
next packet; in the mean time, your Lordship may be assured
that there was no intention, by the assumption of this
title, to degrade the royal authority.</p>

<p>I beg leave to offer my best respects to Lady Holland and
Mr. Allen, and have the honour to be, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="smcap r2">R. Campbell.</p>
</div>


<p class="center"><i>Mr. R. Campbell to Lord Holland.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="r2">Cadiz, Dec. 20th, 1810.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,—The decree which I mentioned in my last
letter with respect to the marriage of the Princes of the
Spanish Blood Royal was actually proposed by Capmany, and
discussed on the 10th. Capmany’s motion was that no King
of Spain or Prince of the blood royal should contract
matrimony with <i>any person whatever</i>, without the
consent of the Cortes lawfully assembled; this is more
general and, as a fundamental Law of the State, more
consistent, perhaps, with sound policy, than the decree to
which I alluded. The motion was referred to the committee
on the constitution, and I hope they will lose no time in
deciding upon it.</p>

<p>Such had been the shameful intriguing and trafficking for
places and pensions, for titles and ribands and crosses
and promotions in the army and navy, frequently conferred
upon the most worthless individuals, during the government
of the Central Junta and of the late Regency, that the
<i>self-denying</i> decree appears to me to have been
absolutely necessary to give the Cortes that degree of
public confidence and popularity which alone could render
their labours of any benefit to the nation.</p>

<p>With respect to the title of Majesty, I am convinced that,
in assuming it, the Cortes had no intention to degrade
the royal dignity and that no democratic views lurk under
this measure. Your Lordship will be pleased to consider
the very peculiar circumstances under which they met. The
nation was <i>then</i> for the first time in the history
of the Monarchy represented by deputies that had the least
shadow of a claim to fair or legitimate election; they had
to give to their country what it never possessed before—a
<i>Constitution</i>, by which the hitherto despotic power
of the King should be limited, and which should be binding
on him as well as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span> on the people. They had to prescribe
to him the conditions upon which the Spanish nation were
willing that he should continue to wear the crown. It was
necessary that, at the first moment of their meeting, they
should make some kind of public and solemn expression of
the sovereign and inherent rights of the nation, lawfully
represented, to form and establish the fundamental laws of
the State. The title of Majesty was therefore not assumed
with levity; its expediency was maturely considered.
It was requisite that the multitude and all ranks and
classes of the State should at once receive the deepest
impression that the authority and dignity of the <i>present
extraordinary</i> Cortes were paramount to every other;
before which all other authorities and dignities must,
for the present, bend. It was necessary, therefore, that
they should be addressed in the language corresponding
to the high dignity of their situation—they could not
otherwise have taken or maintained possession of the lofty
ground upon which they now stand, especially in a country
where, more than in any other, respect and authority
are connected in the minds of the vulgar with title and
external appearance. Besides, the title of Majesty had just
been given to the <i>Central Junta</i> and to the late
Regency; and if the Cortes had not assumed the same title,
it might have been considered as a public acknowledgment
of inferiority in power and dignity to these two bodies.
Had the Cortes taken the title of <i>Highness</i> and left
that of <i>Majesty</i> with the <i>Regency</i>, how would
it have sounded in the ears of a Spanish public that his
<i>Majesty</i> was nominated by and responsible for his
conduct to his <i>Highness</i>? I have not heard it even
insinuated that any future Cortes (or by whatever other
appellation the elective representatives of the people
shall be distinguished) ought to be addressed by the title
of Majesty. This title, it is generally understood, when
the Constitution is established, should belong to the King
<i>alone</i>, as the hereditary representative of the power
and Majesty of the nation.</p>

<p>In addition to all this, your Lordship will have observed
that the title of Majesty was more general in its
application in Spain than it is in England. In England it
belongs exclusively to the King; in Spain, it was likewise
given to the <i>Camera del Consejo Real</i> and to the
<i>Consejo de Guerra</i>. I ought to beg your Lordship’s
pardon for hazarding these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span> hasty opinions, which I submit
with great sincerity to your more enlightened judgment.</p>

<p>A fungous growth of political pamphlets and periodical
publications issue daily from the press. We have the
<i>Conciso</i>, the <i>Tertulia</i>, the <i>Buen
Español</i>, the political <i>Telescope</i>, and I
believe the political <i>Microscope</i> and the political
<i>Spectacles</i>; none of these have any merit except the
<i>Conciso</i>, which gives the best diary we have yet had
of the proceedings of the Cortes; but we have likewise the
<i>Semanario</i>, revived by Quintana, which maintains its
ancient reputation, and the <i>Patriot in the Cortes</i>,
as yet chiefly distinguished for its boldness. Some numbers
of these last I shall do myself the pleasure to send to
your Lordship by the first good opportunity. I should
have requested of Mr. Wellesley or Mr. Vaughan to take
charge of any parcel or packet for you, but they reside at
present in the <i>Isla</i>, whither I seldom go; and which
is so crowded that I could not procure in it a house or
accommodation of any kind. We are and have been in daily
expectation that the Cortes will transfer their sittings to
this city. The Cortes have committed and are <i>daily</i>
committing a great many errors; but they are the errors of
inexperience, and as they have upright intentions and are
not indocile they will, I hope, soon correct such mistakes
as they may inadvertently fall into, more especially when
the forms are once established which are to regulate
their future proceedings; and I am happy to say that this
necessary regulation, the want of which has been already on
many occasions severely felt, will soon take place.</p>

<p>I have seen exaggerated accounts in the English papers of
the yellow fever which prevailed here; it was not virulent
nor general, and has now, I believe, entirely vanished.</p>

<p>The French have at last succeeded in throwing a few
nine-inch shells within our walls from their battery on
the <i>cabezuela of the Trocadero</i>. One fell near the
signal tower, almost in the centre of the city, and distant
from the <i>cabezuela</i> about 2500 French <i>toises</i>,
greater by 200 <i>toises</i> than any range of a shell
formerly known. Not more than a dozen altogether fell
within the walls; they fortunately did no damage and
occasioned very little alarm. I am assured by Artillery
officers that the charge of powder necessary to throw a
shell to such a distance is so great, that after a few
discharges<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span> the mortar will be rendered entirely useless.
A few shells were first fired two or three days ago, a few
more the next day, and they have since been silent. We are
informed that one of their mortars burst.</p>

<p>A general enlistment is now carrying on here and rigorously
executing, of all unmarried men <i>without exception</i>
from the age of 16 to 45. Men we can find in abundance,
but where we can get the means of clothing, arming, and
subsisting them, unless we receive very liberal aid from
England, it is difficult for me to conceive; two days ago,
notwithstanding every measure of economy that has been
adopted and is adopting, there was not a dollar in the
treasury. The Government had applied a few weeks ago to the
<i>Junta</i> of Cadiz for the loan of a million of dollars,
to be repaid upon the arrival of the <i>Bulwark</i> from
Vera Cruz; this the <i>Junta</i> had the scandalous
indecency to refuse, except upon the condition that
the regulation and collection of the customs of the
port of Cadiz should be committed exclusively to their
management, with other stipulations, the effect of which
would have been to erect the <i>Junta</i> into a little
petty sovereignty. This proposition was rejected with
indignation, and the conduct of the <i>Junta</i>, upon this
occasion, has justly rendered them extremely unpopular.
Yesterday morning, the Government, being absolutely without
a dollar, made application to the <i>Consulado</i>, and
a meeting of the most respectable merchants being called
most of whom never had any concern with the <i>Junta</i>, a
great many very patriotic speeches were made, the million
of dollars was immediately granted, without interest
or condition of any kind and to be repaid whenever it
was convenient for the Government. The <i>Bulwark</i>
fortunately arrived in the evening, but has not brought
so much money as was expected, only a million and a half
dollars for the public treasury and about two millions
private property.</p>

<p>I am sure I must have now tired your Lordship completely
with this long and uninteresting letter, to which I shall
here put a close, and have the honour to be most truly,</p>

<p class="center">Your most obedt. Servt.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> Sir George Lyttelton (1709–1773), created Baron Lyttelton
in 1756. He married, first, in 1742, Lucy, daughter of Hugh Fortescue,
Esq., of Filleigh, co. Devon; and secondly, in 1749, Elizabeth,
daughter of Sir Robert Rich, Bart. His son, Thomas, born in 1744,
succeeded his father, but died without issue in 1779, when the peerage
expired. It was, however, re-created in 1794 in favour of a cousin,
from whom the present owner of Hagley, Viscount Cobham, is directly
descended.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> These trees were sent as a present to Queen Mary by a
Dutch merchant. The vessel in which they were placed was wrecked,
and its contents were claimed by the Lord of the Manor, the owner of
Margam. He afterwards offered to restore them, but was given them as a
present by the King.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> Thomas Mansel Talbot married, in 1794, Lady Mary Lucy
Fox-Strangways, second daughter of Henry Thomas, second Earl of
Ilchester, and his first wife Mary Theresa, daughter of Standish
O’Grady, Esq. After Mr. Talbot’s death Lady Mary married, in 1815, Sir
Christopher Cole. She died in 1855. Margam belonged originally to the
Mansel family, and came to the Talbots by marriage. The female line of
the Mansels became extinct in 1750.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a> Lord Plymouth died the preceding June, and their son,
Other Archer, who succeeded as sixth Earl, was at this time a boy of
ten.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[5]</a> Edward, fifth Earl of Oxford of that creation (1773–1848),
who succeeded his cousin in 1790. He married, in 1794, Jane Elizabeth,
daughter of Rev. James Scott, rector of Itchen, Hants. She died in
1824, at the age of fifty-one. Their eldest son, born in 1800, was
drowned in a shipwreck off Jersey in 1828, and the peerage became
extinct after their second son’s death. He succeeded his father in
1848.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[6]</a> Richard Payne Knight (1750–1824), son of Rev. Thomas
Knight, Rector of Bewdley, Worcestershire. He inherited Downton Castle
from his grandfather, Richard Knight, about 1764, but spent many years
in Italy, where he laid the foundations of his collection of coins,
bronzes, and marbles. These he left at his death to the British Museum.
He sat in the House of Commons from 1780 until 1806, and was looked
upon as a recognised authority on the customs and arts of ancient
times.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="label">[7]</a> Charles, eleventh Duke of Norfolk (1746–1815), who
succeeded his father in 1786. He married, first, in 1767, Marian,
daughter of John Coppinger, Esq. She died the following year, and, in
1771, he married Frances, only child of Charles Fitzroy Scudamore, of
Holme Lacy, co. Hereford. On the Duke’s death in 1815 he was succeeded
by his cousin. When the Duchess died in 1820, her property devolved
on the heirs-at-law of her grandfather, the descendants of his sister
Mary, wife of Sir Giles Brydges. The Duke was a firm supporter of the
Whigs, and was dismissed by George III. from the Lord-Lieutenancy of
Sussex in 1798, for an injudicious speech. See <i>ante</i>, i. 177.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="label">[8]</a> Edward Bolton Clive, a connection of Lord Clive, and
sometime M.P. for Hereford. He was eldest son of George Clive and
Sydney, daughter of Thomas Bolton, Esq. He married, in 1790, Harriet,
daughter of Andrew, second Lord Archer.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="label">[9]</a> Captain Charles Morris was born in 1745. He entered
the cavalry and exchanged into the Life Guards. He was an intimate
associate of the Whigs, and many of his songs were directed against
their political opponents. A constant guest at Carlton House, he was
subsequently given a pension by the Prince of Wales, and lived for many
years near Dorking previous to his death in 1838, in his ninety-third
year.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_10" href="#FNanchor_10" class="label">[10]</a> After the departure of Macdonald and the French from
Naples, the town was seized by the Royalist bands and only two or three
isolated fortresses garrisoned by Frenchmen and Neapolitan rebels held
out. The sequence of subsequent affairs is most complicated. It appears
a capitulation under terms was arranged, but was disallowed by Nelson
until the sanction was obtained of the King, who was expected in the
course of a few days. The result was to hand over to the popular fury
many of those who had surrendered on the understanding that their lives
were safe.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11" class="label">[11]</a> A landing was effected near the Helder on August 27, and
three days later the Dutch fleet, consisting of twelve ships of the
line, obeyed Admiral Michell’s summons to surrender. The seamen were
inclined to the Royal cause and forced their officers to take this
course. Until the arrival of the Russians a fortnight later the English
remained on the defensive, then an advance was commenced which proved
unsuccessful. Various small engagements took place with varied result,
but by the middle of October it was found impossible for the allies to
win their way from the islands on which they were encamped. Retreat was
therefore necessary, and a capitulation was arranged.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_12" href="#FNanchor_12" class="label">[12]</a> Sherborne was granted in 1616 to Sir John Digby, first

Digby.</p>

daughter of Henry Hoare, Esq., of Stourhead. The first Baronet had also
a large family by his second wife, Frances Ann, daughter of Richard
Acland, Esq.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_14" href="#FNanchor_14" class="label">[14]</a> John, eleventh Earl of Westmorland (1759–1841). He
succeeded his father in 1774, and married, against the wishes of her
family, in 1782, Sarah Ann, only daughter of Robert Child, Esq., of
Osterley Park. Her death took place in 1793, and Lord Westmorland
married, in 1800, Jane, daughter of R. H. Saunders, Esq., M.D. He was
Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland from 1790 to 1795, and Lord Privy Seal from
1798 until 1827, with a short interval in 1806–7.</p>

Digby, in 1796. She died in 1807, and Mr. Wingfield married, in 1813,
Elizabeth, daughter of William Miles, Esq., of Bisterne, Hants. He

animadverted somewhat severely on his conduct. General Fitzpatrick,
in his first letter, dated August 27, 1799, denied that these were
the true facts. He stated his reasons for refusing to discharge his
debt for the present to Mr. Martindale, an undischarged bankrupt, and
informed him that he had the latter’s sanction to the course he was
taking. He said he hoped, therefore, that Lord Kenyon would take an

he wrote again, on January 20, that his only course was to publish his
letters. These appeared in the <i>True Briton</i>, March 5, 1800.</p>

change soon after Napoleon’s accession to the Consulate. He conceived
a great admiration for the conqueror of Italy, and this feeling was
fostered by the latter’s action in restoring him 7000 Russian soldiers,
clothed in new uniforms, whom the English had refused to include in a
cartel of exchange. Instead of the ally he suddenly became the active
opponent of England and Austria, seized all British ships in his ports,
and ordered Lord Whitworth to retire to Riga.</p>

(<i>Memorials and Correspondence</i>), says: ‘With regard to secession
(that is <i>declared</i> secession) I confess I do not like it as a
measure, but I believe the Duke of Bedford does. I should dislike to
a degree I cannot express to attend again myself: ... but I am so far
from wishing others to do the same, that I even wish for occasions when
you and others may have opportunity of attending.’ Again, on October
21, he writes: ‘The Duke of Bedford, who is here, confirms what you say
of Grey’s intention to attend occasionally, and I shall not be at all
sorry to find myself the sole seceder.’</p>

69. It was also read twice in the House of Commons, but was thrown

was to prohibit the intermarriage of the offending parties. The
second contained an additional clause making the offenders liable to
imprisonment and fine.</p>

<p>The Bill was the result of a Committee appointed by Pitt in 1797,
with Abbot as chairman. It was designed to put an end to the habit,
prevalent in the preceding century, of persons in high office placing
the public moneys to their own account and appropriating to their
own use the interest which thus accrued. It was not even considered
necessary to refund the capital sum at the expiration of their term of
office, when the accounts were closed, and the matter was allowed to
drag on, as in the Hollands’ case, until it was found convenient to pay
off the whole.</p>

<p>The monies were outstanding from Lord Holland’s grandfather’s (Henry
Fox, first Lord Holland) Paymastership. The practice was looked on
as a right, though certain statesmen of the time—the Pitts and
others—refused to benefit by it, and thereby obtained the praise and
increased confidence of the public. The retrospective clauses were not

<p><a id="Footnote_211" href="#FNanchor_211" class="label">[211]</a> With the battle of Austerlitz, late in 1805, ended all
hope of a successful European coalition against Napoleon. The wavering
counsels of the Prussian Cabinet were decided once and for all by the
action of their envoy, Haugwitz, who concluded a treaty with Napoleon
upon receipt of news of the battle. The Austrians had to take the best
terms they could obtain, and by the Treaty of Presburg, in December,
retired from the struggle bereft of their fairest provinces. Napoleon,
who had given the kingdom of Naples to his brother, Joseph, now turned
to make peace with England. He found Fox, the new Foreign Minister,
less pliant than he had hoped. The restitution of Hanover, which had
been handed over to Prussia a few months before, was insisted upon, as
well as the maintenance in Sicily of Ferdinand. To the former demand
Napoleon agreed, and seemed inclined to accede to the latter request,
until he found that the Russian envoy, d’Oubril, was prepared to throw
over England, and sign a separate treaty. He then changed his tone and
demanded the cession of Sicily to Joseph; but by so doing lost the
opportunity for peace with both countries, for the Czar repudiated
the preliminaries signed by d’Oubril, and Fox recalled his envoy from
Paris. The failure of these negotiations put an end for the moment to
Napoleon’s designs on Portugal. A large portion of the French army
never actually reached Bayonne, but was elsewhere employed against the
Prussians. Lord St. Vincent remained with his fleet at Lisbon until it
was evident that the danger of an invasion of Portugal was past; and a
large force of troops, under Lord Rosslyn, who had been assembled at
Plymouth to await eventualities, was at the same time disbanded.</p>

Originally detailed for the Cape of Good Hope, Villaumez had crossed
over to the West Indies on hearing of the capture of the African
settlement by the English. He was unable to elude the vigilance of Sir
Thomas Cochrane, and three squadrons under the command respectively
of Sir John Borlase Warren, Sir Richard Strachan, and Admiral Louis
were despatched to confront him. Villaumez seeing that his fleet could
not hope to escape <i>en masse</i>, gave the order for his ships to
separate. Only one however, was successful in regaining France safely,
and Jerome was only able to save his crew and guns by running his ship
ashore on the coast of France. Sir John Warren’s fleet was despatched
with exemplary haste, but lost several days at Spithead owing to

<p><a id="Footnote_247" href="#FNanchor_247" class="label">[247]</a> In the interval which elapsed since Lady Holland’s last
entry in her journal the whole position of Europe had again changed.
The Prussian army, decimated in one day at Jena and Auerstadt, had
practically ceased to exist; Frederick William was a fugitive at the
eastern end of his dominions in Königsberg. Napoleon had occupied
Berlin, and in two months had become master of many of the Prussian
fortresses, which it should have taken him years to reduce. Lucchesini
in the course of his negotiations for peace in Berlin was even ready to
give up those strongholds which had not surrendered, but the patriotic
party were too strong to allow the King to consent to further ignominy.
Russia was prepared to give her assistance, and this nerved Frederick
William to continue the war. Haugwitz resigned, but the King rendered
this lucky event ineffective by also dismissing Count Stein, the only
really able man in his councils.</p>

This was mainly brought about by General Hamilton’s influence, which

Governorship of New York. A duel took place in which General Hamilton
was shot dead. Burr after this went to the West and established himself
on the Mississippi. He gained over General Wilkinson, the commander of
the United States army at New Orleans, to assist him in his schemes,
though nobody appeared to know their exact trend. Jefferson, however,
grew alarmed, Wilkinson recanted, Burr was arrested, and the whole plot
fell to the ground. Burr was acquitted of actual treason, and went to

Wales by Sir John and Lady Douglas were laid before a Committee of the
Cabinet in 1806 for investigation. It was composed of four members, the
Lord Chancellor, the Lord Chief Justice (Lord Ellenborough), and Lords
Grenville and Spencer, with Sir Samuel Romilly, the Solicitor-General,
as legal adviser. Their report acquitted her of the more serious
charges, but animadverted with severity on the levity of her conduct.
The Princess replied with a letter to the King ‘the joint composition
of Lord Eldon, Mr. Perceval, and Mr. Plomer; the first furnishing the
law, the second the argument, and the third the prolixity. It concluded
with a request to be restored to the comfort and honour of his
Majesty’s royal presence’ (<i>Memoirs of the Whig Party</i>, ii. 151).
This the King referred to the Cabinet, and after many deliberations,
with the exception of Mr. Windham, they concurred in the report.</p>

produced a carriage arranged to closely resemble theirs in every
particular, but flaunting the rival hue. A riot ensued, for which the
Berney family held Coke and Windham responsible, though they had in
no way countenanced the trick. All three candidates were convicted of
treating, but as no petition was brought against Colonel Wodehouse, he
retained the seat. Mr. Coke’s brother, Edward Coke, resigned his seat
for Derby, for which the former was elected; while the latter took the

<p>When the Grenville Ministry first took office on Mr. Pitt’s death no
stipulation was made to the King regarding the Catholic question. The
Irish Catholics, seeing Ministers in power most of whom they knew to
be favourably inclined to their claims, began at once to agitate for
the removal of disadvantages under which they laboured. The greatest
anomaly was, that by the Act of 1793 Irish Catholics could become
officers in the army there (though still unable to rise to certain
staff appointments), but could not hold that rank in England. A
promise, however, had been made at the time that matters would be
speedily readjusted. This and other points were brought to Mr. Fox’s
notice soon after he had taken office, but he advised a postponement
of the suggested petition to Parliament, as likely for the present to
be of no permanent advantage. He stated, however, that he was quite
willing to risk a dissolution of the Ministry on the question, if they
so wished it. Better counsels prevailed; but after Mr. Fox’s death
the matter again came to the front. Ministers were in a dilemma. On
one side they risked the King’s displeasure, on the other they would
be obliged to proclaim certain parts of Ireland where agitation was
breaking out, on a question with which they themselves sympathised. The
former evil was considered the least, and it was decided by a clause
in the Mutiny Act to allow Irish Catholics and Dissenters to serve in
the English army. To this the King was agreeable; but Ministers desired
to go further. It was found easier to bring forward the matter in the
form of a Bill, and one was drafted which opened the staff appointments
to the Catholics, and also allowed English Dissenters to serve in the
army and navy. Lord Howick thought he had received the King’s consent
to this, but subsequently the latter flatly refused to confirm it. The
Bill was dropped, but the Ministers reserved for themselves the right
to bring forward the question again, should circumstances so demand.
This the King requested them to withdraw; they refused, and were at
once dismissed.</p>

whereby the English troops were obliged to withdraw. On his return
to England he was tried by court martial and cashiered. Lord Holland
states in the <i>Memoirs of the Whig Party</i> that this appointment

French Ambassador at Constantinople, Russia thought fit to declare
war with the Porte late in 1806. Alexander, however, had need of all

the English Government that a fleet should be sent to Constantinople
to secure their joint interests, and to demand the dismissal of
Sebastiani. This was done, and Arbuthnot, the British Minister,
was ordered to insist on the latter point, on the pain of instant
bombardment. Unfortunately Arbuthnot had to leave owing to ill health,
and Sir Thomas Duckworth, the British Admiral, allowed himself to
be drawn into fruitless negotiations, and finally withdrew without

Brazil; consequently Lord Strangford returned, but not till after the
Portuguese royal family had already embarked. This is the point here

The Central Junta, in whom the power of calling together the Cortes
rested, decided that as a compromise with the extreme party of reform,
only two chambers (the higher clergy and nobility sitting together in
one) should be summoned to assemble early in March. The advance of the
French, however, postponed the meeting, and the supreme government
was placed in the hands of a Regency of five. These took good care to
keep the power as long as possible, and when the Cortes was at last
found necessary, only one chamber could be elected, and that within the
boundaries of Cadiz, for the French were almost at their gates. See
